C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.
C programming language is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C Programming:
Easy to learn
Structured language
It produces efficient programs
It can handle low-level activities
It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms
C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.
C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.
The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
The UNIX OS was totally written in C.
Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.
Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
Just to give you a little excitement about C programming, I'm going to give you a small conventional C Programming Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link.
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C are - 
Operating Systems
Language Compilers
Assemblers
Text Editors
Print Spoolers
Network Drivers
Modern Programs
Databases
Language Interpreters
Utilities
This tutorial is designed for software programmers with a need to understand the C programming language starting from scratch. This C tutorial will give you enough understanding on C programming language from where you can take yourself to higher level of expertise.
Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies. A basic understanding of any of the programming languages will help you in understanding the C programming concepts and move fast on the learning track.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).

C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.
C programming language is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C Programming:
Easy to learn
Structured language
It produces efficient programs
It can handle low-level activities
It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms
C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.
C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.
The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
The UNIX OS was totally written in C.
Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.
Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
Just to give you a little excitement about C programming, I'm going to give you a small conventional C Programming Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link.
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C are -

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.
Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.
Why use C?
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be  
C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.
C programming language is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C Programming:
Easy to learn
Structured language
It produces efficient programs
It can handle low-level activities
It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms
C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.
C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.
The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
The UNIX OS was totally written in C.
Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.
Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
Just to give you a little excitement about C programming, I'm going to give you a small conventional C Programming Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link.
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C are -

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.
Why use C?
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be  
C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be  
C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.

Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons  
Facts about C

Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.
Why use C?
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be  
C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons  
Facts about C
C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.
C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.
The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
The UNIX OS was totally written in C.
Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.
Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.
Why use C?
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be  
C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.
C programming language is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C Programming:
Easy to learn
Structured language
It produces efficient programs
It can handle low-level activities

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.
Why use C?
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be  
C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be  
C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.
All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important preprocessor directives  
#define
Substitutes a preprocessor macro.
#include
Inserts a particular header from another file.
#undef
Undefines a preprocessor macro.
#ifdef
Returns true if this macro is defined.
#ifndef
Returns true if this macro is not defined.
#if
Tests if a compile time condition is true.
#else
The alternative for #if.
#elif
#else and #if in one statement.
#endif
Ends preprocessor conditional.
#error
Prints error message on stderr.
#pragma
Issues special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method.
Preprocessors Examples
Analyze the following examples to understand various directives.
This directive tells the CPP to replace instances of MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH with 20. Use #define for constants to increase readability.
These directives tell the CPP to get stdio.h from System Libraries and add the text to the current source file. The next line tells CPP to get myheader.h from the local directory and add the content to the current source file.
It tells the CPP to undefine existing FILE_SIZE and define it as 42.
It tells the CPP to define MESSAGE only if MESSAGE isn't already defined.
It tells the CPP to process the statements enclosed if DEBUG is defined. This is useful if you pass the -DDEBUG flag to the gcc compiler at the time of compilation. This will define DEBUG, so you can turn debugging on and off on the fly during compilation.
Predefined Macros
ANSI C defines a number of macros. Although each one is available for use in programming, the predefined macros should not be directly modified.
__DATE__
The current date as a character literal in "MMM DD YYYY" format.
__TIME__
The current time as a character literal in "HH:MM:SS" format.
__FILE__
This contains the current filename as a string literal.
__LINE__
This contains the current line number as a decimal constant.
__STDC__
Defined as 1 when the compiler complies with the ANSI standard.
Let's try the following example  
When the above code in a file test.c is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Preprocessor Operators
The C preprocessor offers the following operators to help create macros  
A macro is normally confined to a single line. The macro continuation operator (\) is used to continue a macro that is too long for a single line. For example  
The stringize or number-sign operator ( '#' ), when used within a macro definition, converts a macro parameter into a string constant. This operator may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The token-pasting operator (##) within a macro definition combines two arguments. It permits two separate tokens in the macro definition to be joined into a single token. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It happened so because this example results in the following actual output from the preprocessor  
This example shows the concatenation of token##n into token34 and here we have used both stringize and token-pasting.
The preprocessor defined operator is used in constant expressions to determine if an identifier is defined using #define. If the specified identifier is defined, the value is true (non-zero). If the symbol is not defined, the value is false (zero). The defined operator is specified as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Parameterized Macros
One of the powerful functions of the CPP is the ability to simulate functions using parameterized macros. For example, we might have some code to square a number as follows  
We can rewrite above the code using a macro as follows  
Macros with arguments must be defined using the #define directive before they can be used. The argument list is enclosed in parentheses and must immediately follow the macro name. Spaces are not allowed between the macro name and open parenthesis. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.
All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important preprocessor directives  
#define
Substitutes a preprocessor macro.
#include
Inserts a particular header from another file.
#undef
Undefines a preprocessor macro.
#ifdef
Returns true if this macro is defined.
#ifndef
Returns true if this macro is not defined.
#if
Tests if a compile time condition is true.
#else
The alternative for #if.
#elif
#else and #if in one statement.
#endif
Ends preprocessor conditional.
#error
Prints error message on stderr.
#pragma
Issues special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method.
Preprocessors Examples
Analyze the following examples to understand various directives.
This directive tells the CPP to replace instances of MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH with 20. Use #define for constants to increase readability.
These directives tell the CPP to get stdio.h from System Libraries and add the text to the current source file. The next line tells CPP to get myheader.h from the local directory and add the content to the current source file.
It tells the CPP to undefine existing FILE_SIZE and define it as 42.
It tells the CPP to define MESSAGE only if MESSAGE isn't already defined.
It tells the CPP to process the statements enclosed if DEBUG is defined. This is useful if you pass the -DDEBUG flag to the gcc compiler at the time of compilation. This will define DEBUG, so you can turn debugging on and off on the fly during compilation.
Predefined Macros
ANSI C defines a number of macros. Although each one is available for use in programming, the predefined macros should not be directly modified.
__DATE__
The current date as a character literal in "MMM DD YYYY" format.
__TIME__
The current time as a character literal in "HH:MM:SS" format.
__FILE__
This contains the current filename as a string literal.
__LINE__
This contains the current line number as a decimal constant.
__STDC__
Defined as 1 when the compiler complies with the ANSI standard.
Let's try the following example  
When the above code in a file test.c is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Preprocessor Operators
The C preprocessor offers the following operators to help create macros  
A macro is normally confined to a single line. The macro continuation operator (\) is used to continue a macro that is too long for a single line. For example  
The stringize or number-sign operator ( '#' ), when used within a macro definition, converts a macro parameter into a string constant. This operator may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The token-pasting operator (##) within a macro definition combines two arguments. It permits two separate tokens in the macro definition to be joined into a single token. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It happened so because this example results in the following actual output from the preprocessor  
This example shows the concatenation of token##n into token34 and here we have used both stringize and token-pasting.
The preprocessor defined operator is used in constant expressions to determine if an identifier is defined using #define. If the specified identifier is defined, the value is true (non-zero). If the symbol is not defined, the value is false (zero). The defined operator is specified as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Parameterized Macros
One of the powerful functions of the CPP is the ability to simulate functions using parameterized macros. For example, we might have some code to square a number as follows  
We can rewrite above the code using a macro as follows  
Macros with arguments must be defined using the #define directive before they can be used. The argument list is enclosed in parentheses and must immediately follow the macro name. Spaces are not allowed between the macro name and open parenthesis. For example

A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.
You request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing directive #include, like you have seen inclusion of stdio.h header file, which comes along with your compiler.
Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file but we do not do it because it will be error-prone and it is not a good idea to copy the content of a header file in the source files, especially if we have multiple source files in a program.
A simple practice in C or C++ programs is that we keep all the constants, macros, system wide global variables, and function prototypes in the header files and include that header file wherever it is required.
Include Syntax
Both the user and the system header files are included using the preprocessing directive #include. It has the following two forms  
This form is used for system header files. It searches for a file named 'file' in a standard list of system directories. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
This form is used for header files of your own program. It searches for a file named 'file' in the directory containing the current file. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
Include Operation
The #include directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the current source file. The output from the preprocessor contains the output already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the #include directive. For example, if you have a header file header.h as follows  
and a main program called program.c that uses the header file, like this  
the compiler will see the same token stream as it would if program.c read.
Once-Only Headers
If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process its contents twice and it will result in an error. The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real contents of the file in a conditional, like this  
This construct is commonly known as a wrapper #ifndef. When the header is included again, the conditional will be false, because HEADER_FILE is defined. The preprocessor will skip over the entire contents of the file, and the compiler will not see it twice.
Computed Includes
Sometimes it is necessary to select one of the several different header files to be included into your program. For instance, they might specify configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating systems. You could do this with a series of conditionals as follows  
But as it grows, it becomes tedious, instead the preprocessor offers the ability to use a macro for the header name. This is called a computed include. Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument of #include, you simply put a macro name there  
SYSTEM_H will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for system_1.h as if the #include had been written that way originally. SYSTEM_H could be defined by your Makefile with a -D option.

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.
All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important preprocessor directives  
#define
Substitutes a preprocessor macro.
#include
Inserts a particular header from another file.
#undef
Undefines a preprocessor macro.
#ifdef
Returns true if this macro is defined.
#ifndef
Returns true if this macro is not defined.
#if
Tests if a compile time condition is true.
#else
The alternative for #if.
#elif
#else and #if in one statement.
#endif
Ends preprocessor conditional.
#error
Prints error message on stderr.
#pragma
Issues special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method.
Preprocessors Examples
Analyze the following examples to understand various directives.
This directive tells the CPP to replace instances of MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH with 20. Use #define for constants to increase readability.
These directives tell the CPP to get stdio.h from System Libraries and add the text to the current source file. The next line tells CPP to get myheader.h from the local directory and add the content to the current source file.
It tells the CPP to undefine existing FILE_SIZE and define it as 42.
It tells the CPP to define MESSAGE only if MESSAGE isn't already defined.
It tells the CPP to process the statements enclosed if DEBUG is defined. This is useful if you pass the -DDEBUG flag to the gcc compiler at the time of compilation. This will define DEBUG, so you can turn debugging on and off on the fly during compilation.
Predefined Macros
ANSI C defines a number of macros. Although each one is available for use in programming, the predefined macros should not be directly modified.
__DATE__
The current date as a character literal in "MMM DD YYYY" format.
__TIME__
The current time as a character literal in "HH:MM:SS" format.
__FILE__
This contains the current filename as a string literal.
__LINE__
This contains the current line number as a decimal constant.
__STDC__
Defined as 1 when the compiler complies with the ANSI standard.
Let's try the following example  
When the above code in a file test.c is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Preprocessor Operators
The C preprocessor offers the following operators to help create macros  
A macro is normally confined to a single line. The macro continuation operator (\) is used to continue a macro that is too long for a single line. For example  
The stringize or number-sign operator ( '#' ), when used within a macro definition, converts a macro parameter into a string constant. This operator may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The token-pasting operator (##) within a macro definition combines two arguments. It permits two separate tokens in the macro definition to be joined into a single token. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It happened so because this example results in the following actual output from the preprocessor  
This example shows the concatenation of token##n into token34 and here we have used both stringize and token-pasting.
The preprocessor defined operator is used in constant expressions to determine if an identifier is defined using #define. If the specified identifier is defined, the value is true (non-zero). If the symbol is not defined, the value is false (zero). The defined operator is specified as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Parameterized Macros
One of the powerful functions of the CPP is the ability to simulate functions using parameterized macros. For example, we might have some code to square a number as follows  
We can rewrite above the code using a macro as follows  
Macros with arguments must be defined using the #define directive before they can be used. The argument list is enclosed in parentheses and must immediately follow the macro name. Spaces are not allowed between the macro name and open parenthesis. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.
You request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing directive #include, like you have seen inclusion of stdio.h header file, which comes along with your compiler.
Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file but we do not do it because it will be error-prone and it is not a good idea to copy the content of a header file in the source files, especially if we have multiple source files in a program.
A simple practice in C or C++ programs is that we keep all the constants, macros, system wide global variables, and function prototypes in the header files and include that header file wherever it is required.
Include Syntax
Both the user and the system header files are included using the preprocessing directive #include. It has the following two forms  
This form is used for system header files. It searches for a file named 'file' in a standard list of system directories. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
This form is used for header files of your own program. It searches for a file named 'file' in the directory containing the current file. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
Include Operation
The #include directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the current source file. The output from the preprocessor contains the output already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the #include directive. For example, if you have a header file header.h as follows  
and a main program called program.c that uses the header file, like this  
the compiler will see the same token stream as it would if program.c read.
Once-Only Headers
If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process its contents twice and it will result in an error. The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real contents of the file in a conditional, like this  
This construct is commonly known as a wrapper #ifndef. When the header is included again, the conditional will be false, because HEADER_FILE is defined. The preprocessor will skip over the entire contents of the file, and the compiler will not see it twice.
Computed Includes
Sometimes it is necessary to select one of the several different header files to be included into your program. For instance, they might specify configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating systems. You could do this with a series of conditionals as follows  
But as it grows, it becomes tedious, instead the preprocessor offers the ability to use a macro for the header name. This is called a computed include. Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument of #include, you simply put a macro name there  
SYSTEM_H will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for system_1.h as if the #include had been written that way originally. SYSTEM_H could be defined by your Makefile with a -D option.

Converting one datatype into another is known as type casting or, type-conversion. For example, if you want to store a 'long' value into a simple integer then you can type cast 'long' to 'int'. You can convert the values from one type to another explicitly using the cast operator as follows  
Consider the following example where the cast operator causes the division of one integer variable by another to be performed as a floating-point operation  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It should be noted here that the cast operator has precedence over division, so the value of sum is first converted to type double and finally it gets divided by count yielding a double value.
Type conversions can be implicit which is performed by the compiler automatically, or it can be specified explicitly through the use of the cast operator. It is considered good programming practice to use the cast operator whenever type conversions are necessary.
Integer Promotion
Integer promotion is the process by which values of integer type "smaller" than int or unsigned int are converted either to int or unsigned int. Consider an example of adding a character with an integer  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, the value of sum is 116 because the compiler is doing integer promotion and converting the value of 'c' to ASCII before performing the actual addition operation.
Usual Arithmetic Conversion
The usual arithmetic conversions are implicitly performed to cast their values to a common type. The compiler first performs integer promotion; if the operands still have different types, then they are converted to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy  
The usual arithmetic conversions are not performed for the assignment operators, nor for the logical operators && and ||. Let us take the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, it is simple to understand that first c gets converted to integer, but as the final value is double, usual arithmetic conversion applies and the compiler converts i and c into 'float' and adds them yielding a 'float' result.

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.
All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important preprocessor directives  
#define
Substitutes a preprocessor macro.
#include
Inserts a particular header from another file.
#undef
Undefines a preprocessor macro.
#ifdef
Returns true if this macro is defined.
#ifndef
Returns true if this macro is not defined.
#if
Tests if a compile time condition is true.
#else
The alternative for #if.
#elif
#else and #if in one statement.
#endif
Ends preprocessor conditional.
#error
Prints error message on stderr.
#pragma
Issues special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method.
Preprocessors Examples
Analyze the following examples to understand various directives.
This directive tells the CPP to replace instances of MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH with 20. Use #define for constants to increase readability.
These directives tell the CPP to get stdio.h from System Libraries and add the text to the current source file. The next line tells CPP to get myheader.h from the local directory and add the content to the current source file.
It tells the CPP to undefine existing FILE_SIZE and define it as 42.
It tells the CPP to define MESSAGE only if MESSAGE isn't already defined.
It tells the CPP to process the statements enclosed if DEBUG is defined. This is useful if you pass the -DDEBUG flag to the gcc compiler at the time of compilation. This will define DEBUG, so you can turn debugging on and off on the fly during compilation.
Predefined Macros
ANSI C defines a number of macros. Although each one is available for use in programming, the predefined macros should not be directly modified.
__DATE__
The current date as a character literal in "MMM DD YYYY" format.
__TIME__
The current time as a character literal in "HH:MM:SS" format.
__FILE__
This contains the current filename as a string literal.
__LINE__
This contains the current line number as a decimal constant.
__STDC__
Defined as 1 when the compiler complies with the ANSI standard.
Let's try the following example  
When the above code in a file test.c is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Preprocessor Operators
The C preprocessor offers the following operators to help create macros  
A macro is normally confined to a single line. The macro continuation operator (\) is used to continue a macro that is too long for a single line. For example  
The stringize or number-sign operator ( '#' ), when used within a macro definition, converts a macro parameter into a string constant. This operator may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The token-pasting operator (##) within a macro definition combines two arguments. It permits two separate tokens in the macro definition to be joined into a single token. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It happened so because this example results in the following actual output from the preprocessor  
This example shows the concatenation of token##n into token34 and here we have used both stringize and token-pasting.
The preprocessor defined operator is used in constant expressions to determine if an identifier is defined using #define. If the specified identifier is defined, the value is true (non-zero). If the symbol is not defined, the value is false (zero). The defined operator is specified as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Parameterized Macros
One of the powerful functions of the CPP is the ability to simulate functions using parameterized macros. For example, we might have some code to square a number as follows  
We can rewrite above the code using a macro as follows  
Macros with arguments must be defined using the #define directive before they can be used. The argument list is enclosed in parentheses and must immediately follow the macro name. Spaces are not allowed between the macro name and open parenthesis. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.
You request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing directive #include, like you have seen inclusion of stdio.h header file, which comes along with your compiler.
Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file but we do not do it because it will be error-prone and it is not a good idea to copy the content of a header file in the source files, especially if we have multiple source files in a program.
A simple practice in C or C++ programs is that we keep all the constants, macros, system wide global variables, and function prototypes in the header files and include that header file wherever it is required.
Include Syntax
Both the user and the system header files are included using the preprocessing directive #include. It has the following two forms  
This form is used for system header files. It searches for a file named 'file' in a standard list of system directories. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
This form is used for header files of your own program. It searches for a file named 'file' in the directory containing the current file. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
Include Operation
The #include directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the current source file. The output from the preprocessor contains the output already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the #include directive. For example, if you have a header file header.h as follows  
and a main program called program.c that uses the header file, like this  
the compiler will see the same token stream as it would if program.c read.
Once-Only Headers
If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process its contents twice and it will result in an error. The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real contents of the file in a conditional, like this  
This construct is commonly known as a wrapper #ifndef. When the header is included again, the conditional will be false, because HEADER_FILE is defined. The preprocessor will skip over the entire contents of the file, and the compiler will not see it twice.
Computed Includes
Sometimes it is necessary to select one of the several different header files to be included into your program. For instance, they might specify configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating systems. You could do this with a series of conditionals as follows  
But as it grows, it becomes tedious, instead the preprocessor offers the ability to use a macro for the header name. This is called a computed include. Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument of #include, you simply put a macro name there  
SYSTEM_H will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for system_1.h as if the #include had been written that way originally. SYSTEM_H could be defined by your Makefile with a -D option.

Converting one datatype into another is known as type casting or, type-conversion. For example, if you want to store a 'long' value into a simple integer then you can type cast 'long' to 'int'. You can convert the values from one type to another explicitly using the cast operator as follows  
Consider the following example where the cast operator causes the division of one integer variable by another to be performed as a floating-point operation  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It should be noted here that the cast operator has precedence over division, so the value of sum is first converted to type double and finally it gets divided by count yielding a double value.
Type conversions can be implicit which is performed by the compiler automatically, or it can be specified explicitly through the use of the cast operator. It is considered good programming practice to use the cast operator whenever type conversions are necessary.
Integer Promotion
Integer promotion is the process by which values of integer type "smaller" than int or unsigned int are converted either to int or unsigned int. Consider an example of adding a character with an integer  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, the value of sum is 116 because the compiler is doing integer promotion and converting the value of 'c' to ASCII before performing the actual addition operation.
Usual Arithmetic Conversion
The usual arithmetic conversions are implicitly performed to cast their values to a common type. The compiler first performs integer promotion; if the operands still have different types, then they are converted to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy  
The usual arithmetic conversions are not performed for the assignment operators, nor for the logical operators && and ||. Let us take the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, it is simple to understand that first c gets converted to integer, but as the final value is double, usual arithmetic conversion applies and the compiler converts i and c into 'float' and adds them yielding a 'float' result.

As such, C programming does not provide direct support for error handling but being a system programming language, it provides you access at lower level in the form of return values. Most of the C or even Unix function calls return -1 or NULL in case of any error and set an error code errno. It is set as a global variable and indicates an error occurred during any function call. You can find various error codes defined in <error.h> header file.
So a C programmer can check the returned values and can take appropriate action depending on the return value. It is a good practice, to set errno to 0 at the time of initializing a program. A value of 0 indicates that there is no error in the program.
errno, perror(). and strerror()
The C programming language provides perror() and strerror() functions which can be used to display the text message associated with errno.
The perror() function displays the string you pass to it, followed by a colon, a space, and then the textual representation of the current errno value.
The strerror() function, which returns a pointer to the textual representation of the current errno value.
Let's try to simulate an error condition and try to open a file which does not exist. Here I'm using both the functions to show the usage, but you can use one or more ways of printing your errors. Second important point to note is that you should use stderr file stream to output all the errors.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Divide by Zero Errors
It is a common problem that at the time of dividing any number, programmers do not check if a divisor is zero and finally it creates a runtime error.
The code below fixes this by checking if the divisor is zero before dividing  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Program Exit Status
It is a common practice to exit with a value of EXIT_SUCCESS in case of program coming out after a successful operation. Here, EXIT_SUCCESS is a macro and it is defined as 0.
If you have an error condition in your program and you are coming out then you should exit with a status EXIT_FAILURE which is defined as -1. So let's write above program as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be  
C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.
All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important preprocessor directives  
#define
Substitutes a preprocessor macro.
#include
Inserts a particular header from another file.
#undef
Undefines a preprocessor macro.
#ifdef
Returns true if this macro is defined.
#ifndef
Returns true if this macro is not defined.
#if
Tests if a compile time condition is true.
#else
The alternative for #if.
#elif
#else and #if in one statement.
#endif
Ends preprocessor conditional.
#error
Prints error message on stderr.
#pragma
Issues special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method.
Preprocessors Examples
Analyze the following examples to understand various directives.
This directive tells the CPP to replace instances of MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH with 20. Use #define for constants to increase readability.
These directives tell the CPP to get stdio.h from System Libraries and add the text to the current source file. The next line tells CPP to get myheader.h from the local directory and add the content to the current source file.
It tells the CPP to undefine existing FILE_SIZE and define it as 42.
It tells the CPP to define MESSAGE only if MESSAGE isn't already defined.
It tells the CPP to process the statements enclosed if DEBUG is defined. This is useful if you pass the -DDEBUG flag to the gcc compiler at the time of compilation. This will define DEBUG, so you can turn debugging on and off on the fly during compilation.
Predefined Macros
ANSI C defines a number of macros. Although each one is available for use in programming, the predefined macros should not be directly modified.
__DATE__
The current date as a character literal in "MMM DD YYYY" format.
__TIME__
The current time as a character literal in "HH:MM:SS" format.
__FILE__
This contains the current filename as a string literal.
__LINE__
This contains the current line number as a decimal constant.
__STDC__
Defined as 1 when the compiler complies with the ANSI standard.
Let's try the following example  
When the above code in a file test.c is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Preprocessor Operators
The C preprocessor offers the following operators to help create macros  
A macro is normally confined to a single line. The macro continuation operator (\) is used to continue a macro that is too long for a single line. For example  
The stringize or number-sign operator ( '#' ), when used within a macro definition, converts a macro parameter into a string constant. This operator may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The token-pasting operator (##) within a macro definition combines two arguments. It permits two separate tokens in the macro definition to be joined into a single token. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It happened so because this example results in the following actual output from the preprocessor  
This example shows the concatenation of token##n into token34 and here we have used both stringize and token-pasting.
The preprocessor defined operator is used in constant expressions to determine if an identifier is defined using #define. If the specified identifier is defined, the value is true (non-zero). If the symbol is not defined, the value is false (zero). The defined operator is specified as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Parameterized Macros
One of the powerful functions of the CPP is the ability to simulate functions using parameterized macros. For example, we might have some code to square a number as follows  
We can rewrite above the code using a macro as follows  
Macros with arguments must be defined using the #define directive before they can be used. The argument list is enclosed in parentheses and must immediately follow the macro name. Spaces are not allowed between the macro name and open parenthesis. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.
You request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing directive #include, like you have seen inclusion of stdio.h header file, which comes along with your compiler.
Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file but we do not do it because it will be error-prone and it is not a good idea to copy the content of a header file in the source files, especially if we have multiple source files in a program.
A simple practice in C or C++ programs is that we keep all the constants, macros, system wide global variables, and function prototypes in the header files and include that header file wherever it is required.
Include Syntax
Both the user and the system header files are included using the preprocessing directive #include. It has the following two forms  
This form is used for system header files. It searches for a file named 'file' in a standard list of system directories. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
This form is used for header files of your own program. It searches for a file named 'file' in the directory containing the current file. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
Include Operation
The #include directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the current source file. The output from the preprocessor contains the output already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the #include directive. For example, if you have a header file header.h as follows  
and a main program called program.c that uses the header file, like this  
the compiler will see the same token stream as it would if program.c read.
Once-Only Headers
If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process its contents twice and it will result in an error. The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real contents of the file in a conditional, like this  
This construct is commonly known as a wrapper #ifndef. When the header is included again, the conditional will be false, because HEADER_FILE is defined. The preprocessor will skip over the entire contents of the file, and the compiler will not see it twice.
Computed Includes
Sometimes it is necessary to select one of the several different header files to be included into your program. For instance, they might specify configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating systems. You could do this with a series of conditionals as follows  
But as it grows, it becomes tedious, instead the preprocessor offers the ability to use a macro for the header name. This is called a computed include. Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument of #include, you simply put a macro name there  
SYSTEM_H will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for system_1.h as if the #include had been written that way originally. SYSTEM_H could be defined by your Makefile with a -D option.

Converting one datatype into another is known as type casting or, type-conversion. For example, if you want to store a 'long' value into a simple integer then you can type cast 'long' to 'int'. You can convert the values from one type to another explicitly using the cast operator as follows  
Consider the following example where the cast operator causes the division of one integer variable by another to be performed as a floating-point operation  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It should be noted here that the cast operator has precedence over division, so the value of sum is first converted to type double and finally it gets divided by count yielding a double value.
Type conversions can be implicit which is performed by the compiler automatically, or it can be specified explicitly through the use of the cast operator. It is considered good programming practice to use the cast operator whenever type conversions are necessary.
Integer Promotion
Integer promotion is the process by which values of integer type "smaller" than int or unsigned int are converted either to int or unsigned int. Consider an example of adding a character with an integer  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, the value of sum is 116 because the compiler is doing integer promotion and converting the value of 'c' to ASCII before performing the actual addition operation.
Usual Arithmetic Conversion
The usual arithmetic conversions are implicitly performed to cast their values to a common type. The compiler first performs integer promotion; if the operands still have different types, then they are converted to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy  
The usual arithmetic conversions are not performed for the assignment operators, nor for the logical operators && and ||. Let us take the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, it is simple to understand that first c gets converted to integer, but as the final value is double, usual arithmetic conversion applies and the compiler converts i and c into 'float' and adds them yielding a 'float' result.

As such, C programming does not provide direct support for error handling but being a system programming language, it provides you access at lower level in the form of return values. Most of the C or even Unix function calls return -1 or NULL in case of any error and set an error code errno. It is set as a global variable and indicates an error occurred during any function call. You can find various error codes defined in <error.h> header file.
So a C programmer can check the returned values and can take appropriate action depending on the return value. It is a good practice, to set errno to 0 at the time of initializing a program. A value of 0 indicates that there is no error in the program.
errno, perror(). and strerror()
The C programming language provides perror() and strerror() functions which can be used to display the text message associated with errno.
The perror() function displays the string you pass to it, followed by a colon, a space, and then the textual representation of the current errno value.
The strerror() function, which returns a pointer to the textual representation of the current errno value.
Let's try to simulate an error condition and try to open a file which does not exist. Here I'm using both the functions to show the usage, but you can use one or more ways of printing your errors. Second important point to note is that you should use stderr file stream to output all the errors.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Divide by Zero Errors
It is a common problem that at the time of dividing any number, programmers do not check if a divisor is zero and finally it creates a runtime error.
The code below fixes this by checking if the divisor is zero before dividing  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Program Exit Status
It is a common practice to exit with a value of EXIT_SUCCESS in case of program coming out after a successful operation. Here, EXIT_SUCCESS is a macro and it is defined as 0.
If you have an error condition in your program and you are coming out then you should exit with a status EXIT_FAILURE which is defined as -1. So let's write above program as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.
The C programming language supports recursion, i.e., a function to call itself. But while using recursion, programmers need to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.
Recursive functions are very useful to solve many mathematical problems, such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.
Number Factorial
The following example calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Fibonacci Series
The following example generates the Fibonacci series for a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.
All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important preprocessor directives  
#define
Substitutes a preprocessor macro.
#include
Inserts a particular header from another file.
#undef
Undefines a preprocessor macro.
#ifdef
Returns true if this macro is defined.
#ifndef
Returns true if this macro is not defined.
#if
Tests if a compile time condition is true.
#else
The alternative for #if.
#elif
#else and #if in one statement.
#endif
Ends preprocessor conditional.
#error
Prints error message on stderr.
#pragma
Issues special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method.
Preprocessors Examples
Analyze the following examples to understand various directives.
This directive tells the CPP to replace instances of MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH with 20. Use #define for constants to increase readability.
These directives tell the CPP to get stdio.h from System Libraries and add the text to the current source file. The next line tells CPP to get myheader.h from the local directory and add the content to the current source file.
It tells the CPP to undefine existing FILE_SIZE and define it as 42.
It tells the CPP to define MESSAGE only if MESSAGE isn't already defined.
It tells the CPP to process the statements enclosed if DEBUG is defined. This is useful if you pass the -DDEBUG flag to the gcc compiler at the time of compilation. This will define DEBUG, so you can turn debugging on and off on the fly during compilation.
Predefined Macros
ANSI C defines a number of macros. Although each one is available for use in programming, the predefined macros should not be directly modified.
__DATE__
The current date as a character literal in "MMM DD YYYY" format.
__TIME__
The current time as a character literal in "HH:MM:SS" format.
__FILE__
This contains the current filename as a string literal.
__LINE__
This contains the current line number as a decimal constant.
__STDC__
Defined as 1 when the compiler complies with the ANSI standard.
Let's try the following example  
When the above code in a file test.c is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Preprocessor Operators
The C preprocessor offers the following operators to help create macros  
A macro is normally confined to a single line. The macro continuation operator (\) is used to continue a macro that is too long for a single line. For example  
The stringize or number-sign operator ( '#' ), when used within a macro definition, converts a macro parameter into a string constant. This operator may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The token-pasting operator (##) within a macro definition combines two arguments. It permits two separate tokens in the macro definition to be joined into a single token. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It happened so because this example results in the following actual output from the preprocessor  
This example shows the concatenation of token##n into token34 and here we have used both stringize and token-pasting.
The preprocessor defined operator is used in constant expressions to determine if an identifier is defined using #define. If the specified identifier is defined, the value is true (non-zero). If the symbol is not defined, the value is false (zero). The defined operator is specified as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Parameterized Macros
One of the powerful functions of the CPP is the ability to simulate functions using parameterized macros. For example, we might have some code to square a number as follows  
We can rewrite above the code using a macro as follows  
Macros with arguments must be defined using the #define directive before they can be used. The argument list is enclosed in parentheses and must immediately follow the macro name. Spaces are not allowed between the macro name and open parenthesis. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.
You request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing directive #include, like you have seen inclusion of stdio.h header file, which comes along with your compiler.
Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file but we do not do it because it will be error-prone and it is not a good idea to copy the content of a header file in the source files, especially if we have multiple source files in a program.
A simple practice in C or C++ programs is that we keep all the constants, macros, system wide global variables, and function prototypes in the header files and include that header file wherever it is required.
Include Syntax
Both the user and the system header files are included using the preprocessing directive #include. It has the following two forms  
This form is used for system header files. It searches for a file named 'file' in a standard list of system directories. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
This form is used for header files of your own program. It searches for a file named 'file' in the directory containing the current file. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
Include Operation
The #include directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the current source file. The output from the preprocessor contains the output already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the #include directive. For example, if you have a header file header.h as follows  
and a main program called program.c that uses the header file, like this  
the compiler will see the same token stream as it would if program.c read.
Once-Only Headers
If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process its contents twice and it will result in an error. The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real contents of the file in a conditional, like this  
This construct is commonly known as a wrapper #ifndef. When the header is included again, the conditional will be false, because HEADER_FILE is defined. The preprocessor will skip over the entire contents of the file, and the compiler will not see it twice.
Computed Includes
Sometimes it is necessary to select one of the several different header files to be included into your program. For instance, they might specify configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating systems. You could do this with a series of conditionals as follows  
But as it grows, it becomes tedious, instead the preprocessor offers the ability to use a macro for the header name. This is called a computed include. Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument of #include, you simply put a macro name there  
SYSTEM_H will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for system_1.h as if the #include had been written that way originally. SYSTEM_H could be defined by your Makefile with a -D option.

Converting one datatype into another is known as type casting or, type-conversion. For example, if you want to store a 'long' value into a simple integer then you can type cast 'long' to 'int'. You can convert the values from one type to another explicitly using the cast operator as follows  
Consider the following example where the cast operator causes the division of one integer variable by another to be performed as a floating-point operation  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It should be noted here that the cast operator has precedence over division, so the value of sum is first converted to type double and finally it gets divided by count yielding a double value.
Type conversions can be implicit which is performed by the compiler automatically, or it can be specified explicitly through the use of the cast operator. It is considered good programming practice to use the cast operator whenever type conversions are necessary.
Integer Promotion
Integer promotion is the process by which values of integer type "smaller" than int or unsigned int are converted either to int or unsigned int. Consider an example of adding a character with an integer  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, the value of sum is 116 because the compiler is doing integer promotion and converting the value of 'c' to ASCII before performing the actual addition operation.
Usual Arithmetic Conversion
The usual arithmetic conversions are implicitly performed to cast their values to a common type. The compiler first performs integer promotion; if the operands still have different types, then they are converted to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy  
The usual arithmetic conversions are not performed for the assignment operators, nor for the logical operators && and ||. Let us take the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, it is simple to understand that first c gets converted to integer, but as the final value is double, usual arithmetic conversion applies and the compiler converts i and c into 'float' and adds them yielding a 'float' result.

As such, C programming does not provide direct support for error handling but being a system programming language, it provides you access at lower level in the form of return values. Most of the C or even Unix function calls return -1 or NULL in case of any error and set an error code errno. It is set as a global variable and indicates an error occurred during any function call. You can find various error codes defined in <error.h> header file.
So a C programmer can check the returned values and can take appropriate action depending on the return value. It is a good practice, to set errno to 0 at the time of initializing a program. A value of 0 indicates that there is no error in the program.
errno, perror(). and strerror()
The C programming language provides perror() and strerror() functions which can be used to display the text message associated with errno.
The perror() function displays the string you pass to it, followed by a colon, a space, and then the textual representation of the current errno value.
The strerror() function, which returns a pointer to the textual representation of the current errno value.
Let's try to simulate an error condition and try to open a file which does not exist. Here I'm using both the functions to show the usage, but you can use one or more ways of printing your errors. Second important point to note is that you should use stderr file stream to output all the errors.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Divide by Zero Errors
It is a common problem that at the time of dividing any number, programmers do not check if a divisor is zero and finally it creates a runtime error.
The code below fixes this by checking if the divisor is zero before dividing  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Program Exit Status
It is a common practice to exit with a value of EXIT_SUCCESS in case of program coming out after a successful operation. Here, EXIT_SUCCESS is a macro and it is defined as 0.
If you have an error condition in your program and you are coming out then you should exit with a status EXIT_FAILURE which is defined as -1. So let's write above program as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.
The C programming language supports recursion, i.e., a function to call itself. But while using recursion, programmers need to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.
Recursive functions are very useful to solve many mathematical problems, such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.
Number Factorial
The following example calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Fibonacci Series
The following example generates the Fibonacci series for a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Sometimes, you may come across a situation, when you want to have a function, which can take variable number of arguments, i.e., parameters, instead of predefined number of parameters. The C programming language provides a solution for this situation and you are allowed to define a function which can accept variable number of parameters based on your requirement. The following example shows the definition of such a function.
It should be noted that the function func() has its last argument as ellipses, i.e. three dotes (...) and the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the total number variable arguments passed. To use such functionality, you need to make use of stdarg.h header file which provides the functions and macros to implement the functionality of variable arguments and follow the given steps  
Define a function with its last parameter as ellipses and the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the number of arguments.
Create a va_list type variable in the function definition. This type is defined in stdarg.h header file.
Use int parameter and va_start macro to initialize the va_list variable to an argument list. The macro va_start is defined in stdarg.h header file.
Use va_arg macro and va_list variable to access each item in argument list.
Use a macro va_end to clean up the memory assigned to va_list variable.
Now let us follow the above steps and write down a simple function which can take the variable number of parameters and return their average  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result. It should be noted that the function average() has been called twice and each time the first argument represents the total number of variable arguments being passed. Only ellipses will be used to pass variable number of arguments.

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then

Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.
All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important preprocessor directives  
#define
Substitutes a preprocessor macro.
#include
Inserts a particular header from another file.
#undef
Undefines a preprocessor macro.
#ifdef
Returns true if this macro is defined.
#ifndef
Returns true if this macro is not defined.
#if
Tests if a compile time condition is true.
#else
The alternative for #if.
#elif
#else and #if in one statement.
#endif
Ends preprocessor conditional.
#error
Prints error message on stderr.
#pragma
Issues special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method.
Preprocessors Examples
Analyze the following examples to understand various directives.
This directive tells the CPP to replace instances of MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH with 20. Use #define for constants to increase readability.
These directives tell the CPP to get stdio.h from System Libraries and add the text to the current source file. The next line tells CPP to get myheader.h from the local directory and add the content to the current source file.
It tells the CPP to undefine existing FILE_SIZE and define it as 42.
It tells the CPP to define MESSAGE only if MESSAGE isn't already defined.
It tells the CPP to process the statements enclosed if DEBUG is defined. This is useful if you pass the -DDEBUG flag to the gcc compiler at the time of compilation. This will define DEBUG, so you can turn debugging on and off on the fly during compilation.
Predefined Macros
ANSI C defines a number of macros. Although each one is available for use in programming, the predefined macros should not be directly modified.
__DATE__
The current date as a character literal in "MMM DD YYYY" format.
__TIME__
The current time as a character literal in "HH:MM:SS" format.
__FILE__
This contains the current filename as a string literal.
__LINE__
This contains the current line number as a decimal constant.
__STDC__
Defined as 1 when the compiler complies with the ANSI standard.
Let's try the following example  
When the above code in a file test.c is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Preprocessor Operators
The C preprocessor offers the following operators to help create macros  
A macro is normally confined to a single line. The macro continuation operator (\) is used to continue a macro that is too long for a single line. For example  
The stringize or number-sign operator ( '#' ), when used within a macro definition, converts a macro parameter into a string constant. This operator may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The token-pasting operator (##) within a macro definition combines two arguments. It permits two separate tokens in the macro definition to be joined into a single token. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It happened so because this example results in the following actual output from the preprocessor  
This example shows the concatenation of token##n into token34 and here we have used both stringize and token-pasting.
The preprocessor defined operator is used in constant expressions to determine if an identifier is defined using #define. If the specified identifier is defined, the value is true (non-zero). If the symbol is not defined, the value is false (zero). The defined operator is specified as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Parameterized Macros
One of the powerful functions of the CPP is the ability to simulate functions using parameterized macros. For example, we might have some code to square a number as follows  
We can rewrite above the code using a macro as follows  
Macros with arguments must be defined using the #define directive before they can be used. The argument list is enclosed in parentheses and must immediately follow the macro name. Spaces are not allowed between the macro name and open parenthesis. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.
You request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing directive #include, like you have seen inclusion of stdio.h header file, which comes along with your compiler.
Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file but we do not do it because it will be error-prone and it is not a good idea to copy the content of a header file in the source files, especially if we have multiple source files in a program.
A simple practice in C or C++ programs is that we keep all the constants, macros, system wide global variables, and function prototypes in the header files and include that header file wherever it is required.
Include Syntax
Both the user and the system header files are included using the preprocessing directive #include. It has the following two forms  
This form is used for system header files. It searches for a file named 'file' in a standard list of system directories. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
This form is used for header files of your own program. It searches for a file named 'file' in the directory containing the current file. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
Include Operation
The #include directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the current source file. The output from the preprocessor contains the output already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the #include directive. For example, if you have a header file header.h as follows  
and a main program called program.c that uses the header file, like this  
the compiler will see the same token stream as it would if program.c read.
Once-Only Headers
If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process its contents twice and it will result in an error. The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real contents of the file in a conditional, like this  
This construct is commonly known as a wrapper #ifndef. When the header is included again, the conditional will be false, because HEADER_FILE is defined. The preprocessor will skip over the entire contents of the file, and the compiler will not see it twice.
Computed Includes
Sometimes it is necessary to select one of the several different header files to be included into your program. For instance, they might specify configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating systems. You could do this with a series of conditionals as follows  
But as it grows, it becomes tedious, instead the preprocessor offers the ability to use a macro for the header name. This is called a computed include. Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument of #include, you simply put a macro name there  
SYSTEM_H will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for system_1.h as if the #include had been written that way originally. SYSTEM_H could be defined by your Makefile with a -D option.

Converting one datatype into another is known as type casting or, type-conversion. For example, if you want to store a 'long' value into a simple integer then you can type cast 'long' to 'int'. You can convert the values from one type to another explicitly using the cast operator as follows  
Consider the following example where the cast operator causes the division of one integer variable by another to be performed as a floating-point operation  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It should be noted here that the cast operator has precedence over division, so the value of sum is first converted to type double and finally it gets divided by count yielding a double value.
Type conversions can be implicit which is performed by the compiler automatically, or it can be specified explicitly through the use of the cast operator. It is considered good programming practice to use the cast operator whenever type conversions are necessary.
Integer Promotion
Integer promotion is the process by which values of integer type "smaller" than int or unsigned int are converted either to int or unsigned int. Consider an example of adding a character with an integer  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, the value of sum is 116 because the compiler is doing integer promotion and converting the value of 'c' to ASCII before performing the actual addition operation.
Usual Arithmetic Conversion
The usual arithmetic conversions are implicitly performed to cast their values to a common type. The compiler first performs integer promotion; if the operands still have different types, then they are converted to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy  
The usual arithmetic conversions are not performed for the assignment operators, nor for the logical operators && and ||. Let us take the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, it is simple to understand that first c gets converted to integer, but as the final value is double, usual arithmetic conversion applies and the compiler converts i and c into 'float' and adds them yielding a 'float' result.

As such, C programming does not provide direct support for error handling but being a system programming language, it provides you access at lower level in the form of return values. Most of the C or even Unix function calls return -1 or NULL in case of any error and set an error code errno. It is set as a global variable and indicates an error occurred during any function call. You can find various error codes defined in <error.h> header file.
So a C programmer can check the returned values and can take appropriate action depending on the return value. It is a good practice, to set errno to 0 at the time of initializing a program. A value of 0 indicates that there is no error in the program.
errno, perror(). and strerror()
The C programming language provides perror() and strerror() functions which can be used to display the text message associated with errno.
The perror() function displays the string you pass to it, followed by a colon, a space, and then the textual representation of the current errno value.
The strerror() function, which returns a pointer to the textual representation of the current errno value.
Let's try to simulate an error condition and try to open a file which does not exist. Here I'm using both the functions to show the usage, but you can use one or more ways of printing your errors. Second important point to note is that you should use stderr file stream to output all the errors.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Divide by Zero Errors
It is a common problem that at the time of dividing any number, programmers do not check if a divisor is zero and finally it creates a runtime error.
The code below fixes this by checking if the divisor is zero before dividing  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Program Exit Status
It is a common practice to exit with a value of EXIT_SUCCESS in case of program coming out after a successful operation. Here, EXIT_SUCCESS is a macro and it is defined as 0.
If you have an error condition in your program and you are coming out then you should exit with a status EXIT_FAILURE which is defined as -1. So let's write above program as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.
The C programming language supports recursion, i.e., a function to call itself. But while using recursion, programmers need to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.
Recursive functions are very useful to solve many mathematical problems, such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.
Number Factorial
The following example calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Fibonacci Series
The following example generates the Fibonacci series for a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Sometimes, you may come across a situation, when you want to have a function, which can take variable number of arguments, i.e., parameters, instead of predefined number of parameters. The C programming language provides a solution for this situation and you are allowed to define a function which can accept variable number of parameters based on your requirement. The following example shows the definition of such a function.
It should be noted that the function func() has its last argument as ellipses, i.e. three dotes (...) and the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the total number variable arguments passed. To use such functionality, you need to make use of stdarg.h header file which provides the functions and macros to implement the functionality of variable arguments and follow the given steps  
Define a function with its last parameter as ellipses and the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the number of arguments.
Create a va_list type variable in the function definition. This type is defined in stdarg.h header file.
Use int parameter and va_start macro to initialize the va_list variable to an argument list. The macro va_start is defined in stdarg.h header file.
Use va_arg macro and va_list variable to access each item in argument list.
Use a macro va_end to clean up the memory assigned to va_list variable.
Now let us follow the above steps and write down a simple function which can take the variable number of parameters and return their average  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result. It should be noted that the function average() has been called twice and each time the first argument represents the total number of variable arguments being passed. Only ellipses will be used to pass variable number of arguments.

This chapter explains dynamic memory management in C. The C programming language provides several functions for memory allocation and management. These functions can be found in the <stdlib.h> header file.
void *calloc(int num, int size);
This function allocates an array of num elements each of which size in bytes will be size.
void free(void *address);
This function releases a block of memory block specified by address.
void *malloc(size_t size);
This function allocates an array of num bytes and leave them uninitialized.
void *realloc(void *address, int newsize);
This function re-allocates memory extending it upto newsize.
Allocating Memory Dynamically
While programming, if you are aware of the size of an array, then it is easy and you can define it as an array. For example, to store a name of any person, it can go up to a maximum of 100 characters, so you can define something as follows  
But now let us consider a situation where you have no idea about the length of the text you need to store, for example, you want to store a detailed description about a topic. Here we need to define a pointer to character without defining how much memory is required and later, based on requirement, we can allocate memory as shown in the below example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result.
Same program can be written using calloc(); only thing is you need to replace malloc with calloc as follows  
So you have complete control and you can pass any size value while allocating memory, unlike arrays where once the size defined, you cannot change it.
Resizing and Releasing Memory
When your program comes out, operating system automatically release all the memory allocated by your program but as a good practice when you are not in need of memory anymore then you should release that memory by calling the function free().
Alternatively, you can increase or decrease the size of an allocated memory block by calling the function realloc(). Let us check the above program once again and make use of realloc() and free() functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result.
You can try the above example without re-allocating extra memory, and strcat() function will give an error due to lack of available memory in description.

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.
All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important preprocessor directives  
#define
Substitutes a preprocessor macro.
#include
Inserts a particular header from another file.
#undef
Undefines a preprocessor macro.
#ifdef
Returns true if this macro is defined.
#ifndef
Returns true if this macro is not defined.
#if
Tests if a compile time condition is true.
#else
The alternative for #if.
#elif
#else and #if in one statement.
#endif
Ends preprocessor conditional.
#error
Prints error message on stderr.
#pragma
Issues special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method.
Preprocessors Examples
Analyze the following examples to understand various directives.
This directive tells the CPP to replace instances of MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH with 20. Use #define for constants to increase readability.
These directives tell the CPP to get stdio.h from System Libraries and add the text to the current source file. The next line tells CPP to get myheader.h from the local directory and add the content to the current source file.
It tells the CPP to undefine existing FILE_SIZE and define it as 42.
It tells the CPP to define MESSAGE only if MESSAGE isn't already defined.
It tells the CPP to process the statements enclosed if DEBUG is defined. This is useful if you pass the -DDEBUG flag to the gcc compiler at the time of compilation. This will define DEBUG, so you can turn debugging on and off on the fly during compilation.
Predefined Macros
ANSI C defines a number of macros. Although each one is available for use in programming, the predefined macros should not be directly modified.
__DATE__
The current date as a character literal in "MMM DD YYYY" format.
__TIME__
The current time as a character literal in "HH:MM:SS" format.
__FILE__
This contains the current filename as a string literal.
__LINE__
This contains the current line number as a decimal constant.
__STDC__
Defined as 1 when the compiler complies with the ANSI standard.
Let's try the following example  
When the above code in a file test.c is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Preprocessor Operators
The C preprocessor offers the following operators to help create macros  
A macro is normally confined to a single line. The macro continuation operator (\) is used to continue a macro that is too long for a single line. For example  
The stringize or number-sign operator ( '#' ), when used within a macro definition, converts a macro parameter into a string constant. This operator may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The token-pasting operator (##) within a macro definition combines two arguments. It permits two separate tokens in the macro definition to be joined into a single token. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It happened so because this example results in the following actual output from the preprocessor  
This example shows the concatenation of token##n into token34 and here we have used both stringize and token-pasting.
The preprocessor defined operator is used in constant expressions to determine if an identifier is defined using #define. If the specified identifier is defined, the value is true (non-zero). If the symbol is not defined, the value is false (zero). The defined operator is specified as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Parameterized Macros
One of the powerful functions of the CPP is the ability to simulate functions using parameterized macros. For example, we might have some code to square a number as follows  
We can rewrite above the code using a macro as follows  
Macros with arguments must be defined using the #define directive before they can be used. The argument list is enclosed in parentheses and must immediately follow the macro name. Spaces are not allowed between the macro name and open parenthesis. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.
You request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing directive #include, like you have seen inclusion of stdio.h header file, which comes along with your compiler.
Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file but we do not do it because it will be error-prone and it is not a good idea to copy the content of a header file in the source files, especially if we have multiple source files in a program.
A simple practice in C or C++ programs is that we keep all the constants, macros, system wide global variables, and function prototypes in the header files and include that header file wherever it is required.
Include Syntax
Both the user and the system header files are included using the preprocessing directive #include. It has the following two forms  
This form is used for system header files. It searches for a file named 'file' in a standard list of system directories. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
This form is used for header files of your own program. It searches for a file named 'file' in the directory containing the current file. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
Include Operation
The #include directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the current source file. The output from the preprocessor contains the output already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the #include directive. For example, if you have a header file header.h as follows  
and a main program called program.c that uses the header file, like this  
the compiler will see the same token stream as it would if program.c read.
Once-Only Headers
If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process its contents twice and it will result in an error. The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real contents of the file in a conditional, like this  
This construct is commonly known as a wrapper #ifndef. When the header is included again, the conditional will be false, because HEADER_FILE is defined. The preprocessor will skip over the entire contents of the file, and the compiler will not see it twice.
Computed Includes
Sometimes it is necessary to select one of the several different header files to be included into your program. For instance, they might specify configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating systems. You could do this with a series of conditionals as follows  
But as it grows, it becomes tedious, instead the preprocessor offers the ability to use a macro for the header name. This is called a computed include. Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument of #include, you simply put a macro name there  
SYSTEM_H will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for system_1.h as if the #include had been written that way originally. SYSTEM_H could be defined by your Makefile with a -D option.

Converting one datatype into another is known as type casting or, type-conversion. For example, if you want to store a 'long' value into a simple integer then you can type cast 'long' to 'int'. You can convert the values from one type to another explicitly using the cast operator as follows  
Consider the following example where the cast operator causes the division of one integer variable by another to be performed as a floating-point operation  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It should be noted here that the cast operator has precedence over division, so the value of sum is first converted to type double and finally it gets divided by count yielding a double value.
Type conversions can be implicit which is performed by the compiler automatically, or it can be specified explicitly through the use of the cast operator. It is considered good programming practice to use the cast operator whenever type conversions are necessary.
Integer Promotion
Integer promotion is the process by which values of integer type "smaller" than int or unsigned int are converted either to int or unsigned int. Consider an example of adding a character with an integer  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, the value of sum is 116 because the compiler is doing integer promotion and converting the value of 'c' to ASCII before performing the actual addition operation.
Usual Arithmetic Conversion
The usual arithmetic conversions are implicitly performed to cast their values to a common type. The compiler first performs integer promotion; if the operands still have different types, then they are converted to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy  
The usual arithmetic conversions are not performed for the assignment operators, nor for the logical operators && and ||. Let us take the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, it is simple to understand that first c gets converted to integer, but as the final value is double, usual arithmetic conversion applies and the compiler converts i and c into 'float' and adds them yielding a 'float' result.

As such, C programming does not provide direct support for error handling but being a system programming language, it provides you access at lower level in the form of return values. Most of the C or even Unix function calls return -1 or NULL in case of any error and set an error code errno. It is set as a global variable and indicates an error occurred during any function call. You can find various error codes defined in <error.h> header file.
So a C programmer can check the returned values and can take appropriate action depending on the return value. It is a good practice, to set errno to 0 at the time of initializing a program. A value of 0 indicates that there is no error in the program.
errno, perror(). and strerror()
The C programming language provides perror() and strerror() functions which can be used to display the text message associated with errno.
The perror() function displays the string you pass to it, followed by a colon, a space, and then the textual representation of the current errno value.
The strerror() function, which returns a pointer to the textual representation of the current errno value.
Let's try to simulate an error condition and try to open a file which does not exist. Here I'm using both the functions to show the usage, but you can use one or more ways of printing your errors. Second important point to note is that you should use stderr file stream to output all the errors.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Divide by Zero Errors
It is a common problem that at the time of dividing any number, programmers do not check if a divisor is zero and finally it creates a runtime error.
The code below fixes this by checking if the divisor is zero before dividing  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Program Exit Status
It is a common practice to exit with a value of EXIT_SUCCESS in case of program coming out after a successful operation. Here, EXIT_SUCCESS is a macro and it is defined as 0.
If you have an error condition in your program and you are coming out then you should exit with a status EXIT_FAILURE which is defined as -1. So let's write above program as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.
The C programming language supports recursion, i.e., a function to call itself. But while using recursion, programmers need to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.
Recursive functions are very useful to solve many mathematical problems, such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.
Number Factorial
The following example calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Fibonacci Series
The following example generates the Fibonacci series for a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Sometimes, you may come across a situation, when you want to have a function, which can take variable number of arguments, i.e., parameters, instead of predefined number of parameters. The C programming language provides a solution for this situation and you are allowed to define a function which can accept variable number of parameters based on your requirement. The following example shows the definition of such a function.
It should be noted that the function func() has its last argument as ellipses, i.e. three dotes (...) and the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the total number variable arguments passed. To use such functionality, you need to make use of stdarg.h header file which provides the functions and macros to implement the functionality of variable arguments and follow the given steps  
Define a function with its last parameter as ellipses and the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the number of arguments.
Create a va_list type variable in the function definition. This type is defined in stdarg.h header file.
Use int parameter and va_start macro to initialize the va_list variable to an argument list. The macro va_start is defined in stdarg.h header file.
Use va_arg macro and va_list variable to access each item in argument list.
Use a macro va_end to clean up the memory assigned to va_list variable.
Now let us follow the above steps and write down a simple function which can take the variable number of parameters and return their average  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result. It should be noted that the function average() has been called twice and each time the first argument represents the total number of variable arguments being passed. Only ellipses will be used to pass variable number of arguments.

This chapter explains dynamic memory management in C. The C programming language provides several functions for memory allocation and management. These functions can be found in the <stdlib.h> header file.
void *calloc(int num, int size);
This function allocates an array of num elements each of which size in bytes will be size.
void free(void *address);
This function releases a block of memory block specified by address.
void *malloc(size_t size);
This function allocates an array of num bytes and leave them uninitialized.
void *realloc(void *address, int newsize);
This function re-allocates memory extending it upto newsize.
Allocating Memory Dynamically
While programming, if you are aware of the size of an array, then it is easy and you can define it as an array. For example, to store a name of any person, it can go up to a maximum of 100 characters, so you can define something as follows  
But now let us consider a situation where you have no idea about the length of the text you need to store, for example, you want to store a detailed description about a topic. Here we need to define a pointer to character without defining how much memory is required and later, based on requirement, we can allocate memory as shown in the below example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result.
Same program can be written using calloc(); only thing is you need to replace malloc with calloc as follows  
So you have complete control and you can pass any size value while allocating memory, unlike arrays where once the size defined, you cannot change it.
Resizing and Releasing Memory
When your program comes out, operating system automatically release all the memory allocated by your program but as a good practice when you are not in need of memory anymore then you should release that memory by calling the function free().
Alternatively, you can increase or decrease the size of an allocated memory block by calling the function realloc(). Let us check the above program once again and make use of realloc() and free() functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result.
You can try the above example without re-allocating extra memory, and strcat() function will give an error due to lack of available memory in description.

It is possible to pass some values from the command line to your C programs when they are executed. These values are called command line arguments and many times they are important for your program especially when you want to control your program from outside instead of hard coding those values inside the code.
The command line arguments are handled using main() function arguments where argc refers to the number of arguments passed, and argv[] is a pointer array which points to each argument passed to the program. Following is a simple example which checks if there is any argument supplied from the command line and take action accordingly  
When the above code is compiled and executed with single argument, it produces the following result.
When the above code is compiled and executed with a two arguments, it produces the following result.
When the above code is compiled and executed without passing any argument, it produces the following result.
It should be noted that argv[0] holds the name of the program itself and argv[1] is a pointer to the first command line argument supplied, and *argv[n] is the last argument. If no arguments are supplied, argc will be one, and if you pass one argument then argc is set at 2.
You pass all the command line arguments separated by a space, but if argument itself has a space then you can pass such arguments by putting them inside double quotes "" or single quotes ''. Let us re-write above example once again where we will print program name and we also pass a command line argument by putting inside double quotes  
When the above code is compiled and executed with a single argument separated by space but inside double quotes, it produces the following result.

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.
All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important preprocessor directives  
#define
Substitutes a preprocessor macro.
#include
Inserts a particular header from another file.
#undef
Undefines a preprocessor macro.
#ifdef
Returns true if this macro is defined.
#ifndef
Returns true if this macro is not defined.
#if
Tests if a compile time condition is true.
#else
The alternative for #if.
#elif
#else and #if in one statement.
#endif
Ends preprocessor conditional.
#error
Prints error message on stderr.
#pragma
Issues special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method.
Preprocessors Examples
Analyze the following examples to understand various directives.
This directive tells the CPP to replace instances of MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH with 20. Use #define for constants to increase readability.
These directives tell the CPP to get stdio.h from System Libraries and add the text to the current source file. The next line tells CPP to get myheader.h from the local directory and add the content to the current source file.
It tells the CPP to undefine existing FILE_SIZE and define it as 42.
It tells the CPP to define MESSAGE only if MESSAGE isn't already defined.
It tells the CPP to process the statements enclosed if DEBUG is defined. This is useful if you pass the -DDEBUG flag to the gcc compiler at the time of compilation. This will define DEBUG, so you can turn debugging on and off on the fly during compilation.
Predefined Macros
ANSI C defines a number of macros. Although each one is available for use in programming, the predefined macros should not be directly modified.
__DATE__
The current date as a character literal in "MMM DD YYYY" format.
__TIME__
The current time as a character literal in "HH:MM:SS" format.
__FILE__
This contains the current filename as a string literal.
__LINE__
This contains the current line number as a decimal constant.
__STDC__
Defined as 1 when the compiler complies with the ANSI standard.
Let's try the following example  
When the above code in a file test.c is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Preprocessor Operators
The C preprocessor offers the following operators to help create macros  
A macro is normally confined to a single line. The macro continuation operator (\) is used to continue a macro that is too long for a single line. For example  
The stringize or number-sign operator ( '#' ), when used within a macro definition, converts a macro parameter into a string constant. This operator may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The token-pasting operator (##) within a macro definition combines two arguments. It permits two separate tokens in the macro definition to be joined into a single token. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It happened so because this example results in the following actual output from the preprocessor  
This example shows the concatenation of token##n into token34 and here we have used both stringize and token-pasting.
The preprocessor defined operator is used in constant expressions to determine if an identifier is defined using #define. If the specified identifier is defined, the value is true (non-zero). If the symbol is not defined, the value is false (zero). The defined operator is specified as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Parameterized Macros
One of the powerful functions of the CPP is the ability to simulate functions using parameterized macros. For example, we might have some code to square a number as follows  
We can rewrite above the code using a macro as follows  
Macros with arguments must be defined using the #define directive before they can be used. The argument list is enclosed in parentheses and must immediately follow the macro name. Spaces are not allowed between the macro name and open parenthesis. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.
You request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing directive #include, like you have seen inclusion of stdio.h header file, which comes along with your compiler.
Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file but we do not do it because it will be error-prone and it is not a good idea to copy the content of a header file in the source files, especially if we have multiple source files in a program.
A simple practice in C or C++ programs is that we keep all the constants, macros, system wide global variables, and function prototypes in the header files and include that header file wherever it is required.
Include Syntax
Both the user and the system header files are included using the preprocessing directive #include. It has the following two forms  
This form is used for system header files. It searches for a file named 'file' in a standard list of system directories. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
This form is used for header files of your own program. It searches for a file named 'file' in the directory containing the current file. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
Include Operation
The #include directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the current source file. The output from the preprocessor contains the output already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the #include directive. For example, if you have a header file header.h as follows  
and a main program called program.c that uses the header file, like this  
the compiler will see the same token stream as it would if program.c read.
Once-Only Headers
If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process its contents twice and it will result in an error. The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real contents of the file in a conditional, like this  
This construct is commonly known as a wrapper #ifndef. When the header is included again, the conditional will be false, because HEADER_FILE is defined. The preprocessor will skip over the entire contents of the file, and the compiler will not see it twice.
Computed Includes
Sometimes it is necessary to select one of the several different header files to be included into your program. For instance, they might specify configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating systems. You could do this with a series of conditionals as follows  
But as it grows, it becomes tedious, instead the preprocessor offers the ability to use a macro for the header name. This is called a computed include. Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument of #include, you simply put a macro name there  
SYSTEM_H will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for system_1.h as if the #include had been written that way originally. SYSTEM_H could be defined by your Makefile with a -D option.

Converting one datatype into another is known as type casting or, type-conversion. For example, if you want to store a 'long' value into a simple integer then you can type cast 'long' to 'int'. You can convert the values from one type to another explicitly using the cast operator as follows  
Consider the following example where the cast operator causes the division of one integer variable by another to be performed as a floating-point operation  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It should be noted here that the cast operator has precedence over division, so the value of sum is first converted to type double and finally it gets divided by count yielding a double value.
Type conversions can be implicit which is performed by the compiler automatically, or it can be specified explicitly through the use of the cast operator. It is considered good programming practice to use the cast operator whenever type conversions are necessary.
Integer Promotion
Integer promotion is the process by which values of integer type "smaller" than int or unsigned int are converted either to int or unsigned int. Consider an example of adding a character with an integer  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, the value of sum is 116 because the compiler is doing integer promotion and converting the value of 'c' to ASCII before performing the actual addition operation.
Usual Arithmetic Conversion
The usual arithmetic conversions are implicitly performed to cast their values to a common type. The compiler first performs integer promotion; if the operands still have different types, then they are converted to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy  
The usual arithmetic conversions are not performed for the assignment operators, nor for the logical operators && and ||. Let us take the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, it is simple to understand that first c gets converted to integer, but as the final value is double, usual arithmetic conversion applies and the compiler converts i and c into 'float' and adds them yielding a 'float' result.

As such, C programming does not provide direct support for error handling but being a system programming language, it provides you access at lower level in the form of return values. Most of the C or even Unix function calls return -1 or NULL in case of any error and set an error code errno. It is set as a global variable and indicates an error occurred during any function call. You can find various error codes defined in <error.h> header file.
So a C programmer can check the returned values and can take appropriate action depending on the return value. It is a good practice, to set errno to 0 at the time of initializing a program. A value of 0 indicates that there is no error in the program.
errno, perror(). and strerror()
The C programming language provides perror() and strerror() functions which can be used to display the text message associated with errno.
The perror() function displays the string you pass to it, followed by a colon, a space, and then the textual representation of the current errno value.
The strerror() function, which returns a pointer to the textual representation of the current errno value.
Let's try to simulate an error condition and try to open a file which does not exist. Here I'm using both the functions to show the usage, but you can use one or more ways of printing your errors. Second important point to note is that you should use stderr file stream to output all the errors.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Divide by Zero Errors
It is a common problem that at the time of dividing any number, programmers do not check if a divisor is zero and finally it creates a runtime error.
The code below fixes this by checking if the divisor is zero before dividing  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Program Exit Status
It is a common practice to exit with a value of EXIT_SUCCESS in case of program coming out after a successful operation. Here, EXIT_SUCCESS is a macro and it is defined as 0.
If you have an error condition in your program and you are coming out then you should exit with a status EXIT_FAILURE which is defined as -1. So let's write above program as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.
The C programming language supports recursion, i.e., a function to call itself. But while using recursion, programmers need to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.
Recursive functions are very useful to solve many mathematical problems, such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.
Number Factorial
The following example calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Fibonacci Series
The following example generates the Fibonacci series for a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Sometimes, you may come across a situation, when you want to have a function, which can take variable number of arguments, i.e., parameters, instead of predefined number of parameters. The C programming language provides a solution for this situation and you are allowed to define a function which can accept variable number of parameters based on your requirement. The following example shows the definition of such a function.
It should be noted that the function func() has its last argument as ellipses, i.e. three dotes (...) and the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the total number variable arguments passed. To use such functionality, you need to make use of stdarg.h header file which provides the functions and macros to implement the functionality of variable arguments and follow the given steps  
Define a function with its last parameter as ellipses and the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the number of arguments.
Create a va_list type variable in the function definition. This type is defined in stdarg.h header file.
Use int parameter and va_start macro to initialize the va_list variable to an argument list. The macro va_start is defined in stdarg.h header file.
Use va_arg macro and va_list variable to access each item in argument list.
Use a macro va_end to clean up the memory assigned to va_list variable.
Now let us follow the above steps and write down a simple function which can take the variable number of parameters and return their average  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result. It should be noted that the function average() has been called twice and each time the first argument represents the total number of variable arguments being passed. Only ellipses will be used to pass variable number of arguments.

This chapter explains dynamic memory management in C. The C programming language provides several functions for memory allocation and management. These functions can be found in the <stdlib.h> header file.
void *calloc(int num, int size);
This function allocates an array of num elements each of which size in bytes will be size.
void free(void *address);
This function releases a block of memory block specified by address.
void *malloc(size_t size);
This function allocates an array of num bytes and leave them uninitialized.
void *realloc(void *address, int newsize);
This function re-allocates memory extending it upto newsize.
Allocating Memory Dynamically
While programming, if you are aware of the size of an array, then it is easy and you can define it as an array. For example, to store a name of any person, it can go up to a maximum of 100 characters, so you can define something as follows  
But now let us consider a situation where you have no idea about the length of the text you need to store, for example, you want to store a detailed description about a topic. Here we need to define a pointer to character without defining how much memory is required and later, based on requirement, we can allocate memory as shown in the below example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result.
Same program can be written using calloc(); only thing is you need to replace malloc with calloc as follows  
So you have complete control and you can pass any size value while allocating memory, unlike arrays where once the size defined, you cannot change it.
Resizing and Releasing Memory
When your program comes out, operating system automatically release all the memory allocated by your program but as a good practice when you are not in need of memory anymore then you should release that memory by calling the function free().
Alternatively, you can increase or decrease the size of an allocated memory block by calling the function realloc(). Let us check the above program once again and make use of realloc() and free() functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result.
You can try the above example without re-allocating extra memory, and strcat() function will give an error due to lack of available memory in description.

It is possible to pass some values from the command line to your C programs when they are executed. These values are called command line arguments and many times they are important for your program especially when you want to control your program from outside instead of hard coding those values inside the code.
The command line arguments are handled using main() function arguments where argc refers to the number of arguments passed, and argv[] is a pointer array which points to each argument passed to the program. Following is a simple example which checks if there is any argument supplied from the command line and take action accordingly  
When the above code is compiled and executed with single argument, it produces the following result.
When the above code is compiled and executed with a two arguments, it produces the following result.
When the above code is compiled and executed without passing any argument, it produces the following result.
It should be noted that argv[0] holds the name of the program itself and argv[1] is a pointer to the first command line argument supplied, and *argv[n] is the last argument. If no arguments are supplied, argc will be one, and if you pass one argument then argc is set at 2.
You pass all the command line arguments separated by a space, but if argument itself has a space then you can pass such arguments by putting them inside double quotes "" or single quotes ''. Let us re-write above example once again where we will print program name and we also pass a command line argument by putting inside double quotes  
When the above code is compiled and executed with a single argument separated by space but inside double quotes, it produces the following result.

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.
The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
The UNIX OS was totally written in C.
Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.
Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.
Why use C?
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be  
C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.
All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important preprocessor directives  
#define
Substitutes a preprocessor macro.
#include
Inserts a particular header from another file.
#undef
Undefines a preprocessor macro.
#ifdef
Returns true if this macro is defined.
#ifndef
Returns true if this macro is not defined.
#if
Tests if a compile time condition is true.
#else
The alternative for #if.
#elif
#else and #if in one statement.
#endif
Ends preprocessor conditional.
#error
Prints error message on stderr.
#pragma
Issues special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method.
Preprocessors Examples
Analyze the following examples to understand various directives.
This directive tells the CPP to replace instances of MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH with 20. Use #define for constants to increase readability.
These directives tell the CPP to get stdio.h from System Libraries and add the text to the current source file. The next line tells CPP to get myheader.h from the local directory and add the content to the current source file.
It tells the CPP to undefine existing FILE_SIZE and define it as 42.
It tells the CPP to define MESSAGE only if MESSAGE isn't already defined.
It tells the CPP to process the statements enclosed if DEBUG is defined. This is useful if you pass the -DDEBUG flag to the gcc compiler at the time of compilation. This will define DEBUG, so you can turn debugging on and off on the fly during compilation.
Predefined Macros
ANSI C defines a number of macros. Although each one is available for use in programming, the predefined macros should not be directly modified.
__DATE__
The current date as a character literal in "MMM DD YYYY" format.
__TIME__
The current time as a character literal in "HH:MM:SS" format.
__FILE__
This contains the current filename as a string literal.
__LINE__
This contains the current line number as a decimal constant.
__STDC__
Defined as 1 when the compiler complies with the ANSI standard.
Let's try the following example  
When the above code in a file test.c is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Preprocessor Operators
The C preprocessor offers the following operators to help create macros  
A macro is normally confined to a single line. The macro continuation operator (\) is used to continue a macro that is too long for a single line. For example  
The stringize or number-sign operator ( '#' ), when used within a macro definition, converts a macro parameter into a string constant. This operator may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The token-pasting operator (##) within a macro definition combines two arguments. It permits two separate tokens in the macro definition to be joined into a single token. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It happened so because this example results in the following actual output from the preprocessor  
This example shows the concatenation of token##n into token34 and here we have used both stringize and token-pasting.
The preprocessor defined operator is used in constant expressions to determine if an identifier is defined using #define. If the specified identifier is defined, the value is true (non-zero). If the symbol is not defined, the value is false (zero). The defined operator is specified as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Parameterized Macros
One of the powerful functions of the CPP is the ability to simulate functions using parameterized macros. For example, we might have some code to square a number as follows  
We can rewrite above the code using a macro as follows  
Macros with arguments must be defined using the #define directive before they can be used. The argument list is enclosed in parentheses and must immediately follow the macro name. Spaces are not allowed between the macro name and open parenthesis. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.
You request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing directive #include, like you have seen inclusion of stdio.h header file, which comes along with your compiler.
Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file but we do not do it because it will be error-prone and it is not a good idea to copy the content of a header file in the source files, especially if we have multiple source files in a program.
A simple practice in C or C++ programs is that we keep all the constants, macros, system wide global variables, and function prototypes in the header files and include that header file wherever it is required.
Include Syntax
Both the user and the system header files are included using the preprocessing directive #include. It has the following two forms  
This form is used for system header files. It searches for a file named 'file' in a standard list of system directories. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
This form is used for header files of your own program. It searches for a file named 'file' in the directory containing the current file. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
Include Operation
The #include directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the current source file. The output from the preprocessor contains the output already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the #include directive. For example, if you have a header file header.h as follows  
and a main program called program.c that uses the header file, like this  
the compiler will see the same token stream as it would if program.c read.
Once-Only Headers
If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process its contents twice and it will result in an error. The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real contents of the file in a conditional, like this  
This construct is commonly known as a wrapper #ifndef. When the header is included again, the conditional will be false, because HEADER_FILE is defined. The preprocessor will skip over the entire contents of the file, and the compiler will not see it twice.
Computed Includes
Sometimes it is necessary to select one of the several different header files to be included into your program. For instance, they might specify configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating systems. You could do this with a series of conditionals as follows  
But as it grows, it becomes tedious, instead the preprocessor offers the ability to use a macro for the header name. This is called a computed include. Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument of #include, you simply put a macro name there  
SYSTEM_H will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for system_1.h as if the #include had been written that way originally. SYSTEM_H could be defined by your Makefile with a -D option.

Converting one datatype into another is known as type casting or, type-conversion. For example, if you want to store a 'long' value into a simple integer then you can type cast 'long' to 'int'. You can convert the values from one type to another explicitly using the cast operator as follows  
Consider the following example where the cast operator causes the division of one integer variable by another to be performed as a floating-point operation  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It should be noted here that the cast operator has precedence over division, so the value of sum is first converted to type double and finally it gets divided by count yielding a double value.
Type conversions can be implicit which is performed by the compiler automatically, or it can be specified explicitly through the use of the cast operator. It is considered good programming practice to use the cast operator whenever type conversions are necessary.
Integer Promotion
Integer promotion is the process by which values of integer type "smaller" than int or unsigned int are converted either to int or unsigned int. Consider an example of adding a character with an integer  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, the value of sum is 116 because the compiler is doing integer promotion and converting the value of 'c' to ASCII before performing the actual addition operation.
Usual Arithmetic Conversion
The usual arithmetic conversions are implicitly performed to cast their values to a common type. The compiler first performs integer promotion; if the operands still have different types, then they are converted to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy  
The usual arithmetic conversions are not performed for the assignment operators, nor for the logical operators && and ||. Let us take the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, it is simple to understand that first c gets converted to integer, but as the final value is double, usual arithmetic conversion applies and the compiler converts i and c into 'float' and adds them yielding a 'float' result.

As such, C programming does not provide direct support for error handling but being a system programming language, it provides you access at lower level in the form of return values. Most of the C or even Unix function calls return -1 or NULL in case of any error and set an error code errno. It is set as a global variable and indicates an error occurred during any function call. You can find various error codes defined in <error.h> header file.
So a C programmer can check the returned values and can take appropriate action depending on the return value. It is a good practice, to set errno to 0 at the time of initializing a program. A value of 0 indicates that there is no error in the program.
errno, perror(). and strerror()
The C programming language provides perror() and strerror() functions which can be used to display the text message associated with errno.
The perror() function displays the string you pass to it, followed by a colon, a space, and then the textual representation of the current errno value.
The strerror() function, which returns a pointer to the textual representation of the current errno value.
Let's try to simulate an error condition and try to open a file which does not exist. Here I'm using both the functions to show the usage, but you can use one or more ways of printing your errors. Second important point to note is that you should use stderr file stream to output all the errors.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Divide by Zero Errors
It is a common problem that at the time of dividing any number, programmers do not check if a divisor is zero and finally it creates a runtime error.
The code below fixes this by checking if the divisor is zero before dividing  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Program Exit Status
It is a common practice to exit with a value of EXIT_SUCCESS in case of program coming out after a successful operation. Here, EXIT_SUCCESS is a macro and it is defined as 0.
If you have an error condition in your program and you are coming out then you should exit with a status EXIT_FAILURE which is defined as -1. So let's write above program as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.
The C programming language supports recursion, i.e., a function to call itself. But while using recursion, programmers need to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.
Recursive functions are very useful to solve many mathematical problems, such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.
Number Factorial
The following example calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Fibonacci Series

Sometimes, you may come across a situation, when you want to have a function, which can take variable number of arguments, i.e., parameters, instead of predefined number of parameters. The C programming language provides a solution for this situation and you are allowed to define a function which can accept variable number of parameters based on your requirement. The following example shows the definition of such a function.
It should be noted that the function func() has its last argument as ellipses, i.e. three dotes (...) and the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the total number variable arguments passed. To use such functionality, you need to make use of stdarg.h header file which provides the functions and macros to implement the functionality of variable arguments and follow the given steps  
Define a function with its last parameter as ellipses and the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the number of arguments.
Create a va_list type variable in the function definition. This type is defined in stdarg.h header file.
Use int parameter and va_start macro to initialize the va_list variable to an argument list. The macro va_start is defined in stdarg.h header file.
Use va_arg macro and va_list variable to access each item in argument list.
Use a macro va_end to clean up the memory assigned to va_list variable.
Now let us follow the above steps and write down a simple function which can take the variable number of parameters and return their average  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result. It should be noted that the function average() has been called twice and each time the first argument represents the total number of variable arguments being passed. Only ellipses will be used to pass variable number of arguments.

This chapter explains dynamic memory management in C. The C programming language provides several functions for memory allocation and management. These functions can be found in the <stdlib.h> header file.
void *calloc(int num, int size);
This function allocates an array of num elements each of which size in bytes will be size.
void free(void *address);
This function releases a block of memory block specified by address.
void *malloc(size_t size);
This function allocates an array of num bytes and leave them uninitialized.
void *realloc(void *address, int newsize);
This function re-allocates memory extending it upto newsize.
Allocating Memory Dynamically
While programming, if you are aware of the size of an array, then it is easy and you can define it as an array. For example, to store a name of any person, it can go up to a maximum of 100 characters, so you can define something as follows  
But now let us consider a situation where you have no idea about the length of the text you need to store, for example, you want to store a detailed description about a topic. Here we need to define a pointer to character without defining how much memory is required and later, based on requirement, we can allocate memory as shown in the below example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result.
Same program can be written using calloc(); only thing is you need to replace malloc with calloc as follows  
So you have complete control and you can pass any size value while allocating memory, unlike arrays where once the size defined, you cannot change it.
Resizing and Releasing Memory
When your program comes out, operating system automatically release all the memory allocated by your program but as a good practice when you are not in need of memory anymore then you should release that memory by calling the function free().
Alternatively, you can increase or decrease the size of an allocated memory block by calling the function realloc(). Let us check the above program once again and make use of realloc() and free() functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result.
You can try the above example without re-allocating extra memory, and strcat() function will give an error due to lack of available memory in description.

It is possible to pass some values from the command line to your C programs when they are executed. These values are called command line arguments and many times they are important for your program especially when you want to control your program from outside instead of hard coding those values inside the code.
The command line arguments are handled using main() function arguments where argc refers to the number of arguments passed, and argv[] is a pointer array which points to each argument passed to the program. Following is a simple example which checks if there is any argument supplied from the command line and take action accordingly  
When the above code is compiled and executed with single argument, it produces the following result.
When the above code is compiled and executed with a two arguments, it produces the following result.
When the above code is compiled and executed without passing any argument, it produces the following result.
It should be noted that argv[0] holds the name of the program itself and argv[1] is a pointer to the first command line argument supplied, and *argv[n] is the last argument. If no arguments are supplied, argc will be one, and if you pass one argument then argc is set at 2.
You pass all the command line arguments separated by a space, but if argument itself has a space then you can pass such arguments by putting them inside double quotes "" or single quotes ''. Let us re-write above example once again where we will print program name and we also pass a command line argument by putting inside double quotes  
When the above code is compiled and executed with a single argument separated by space but inside double quotes, it produces the following result.

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.
Why use C?
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be  
C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.
All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important preprocessor directives  
#define
Substitutes a preprocessor macro.
#include
Inserts a particular header from another file.
#undef
Undefines a preprocessor macro.
#ifdef
Returns true if this macro is defined.
#ifndef
Returns true if this macro is not defined.
#if
Tests if a compile time condition is true.
#else
The alternative for #if.
#elif
#else and #if in one statement.
#endif
Ends preprocessor conditional.
#error
Prints error message on stderr.
#pragma
Issues special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method.
Preprocessors Examples
Analyze the following examples to understand various directives.
This directive tells the CPP to replace instances of MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH with 20. Use #define for constants to increase readability.
These directives tell the CPP to get stdio.h from System Libraries and add the text to the current source file. The next line tells CPP to get myheader.h from the local directory and add the content to the current source file.
It tells the CPP to undefine existing FILE_SIZE and define it as 42.
It tells the CPP to define MESSAGE only if MESSAGE isn't already defined.
It tells the CPP to process the statements enclosed if DEBUG is defined. This is useful if you pass the -DDEBUG flag to the gcc compiler at the time of compilation. This will define DEBUG, so you can turn debugging on and off on the fly during compilation.
Predefined Macros
ANSI C defines a number of macros. Although each one is available for use in programming, the predefined macros should not be directly modified.
__DATE__
The current date as a character literal in "MMM DD YYYY" format.
__TIME__
The current time as a character literal in "HH:MM:SS" format.
__FILE__
This contains the current filename as a string literal.
__LINE__
This contains the current line number as a decimal constant.
__STDC__
Defined as 1 when the compiler complies with the ANSI standard.
Let's try the following example  
When the above code in a file test.c is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Preprocessor Operators
The C preprocessor offers the following operators to help create macros  
A macro is normally confined to a single line. The macro continuation operator (\) is used to continue a macro that is too long for a single line. For example  
The stringize or number-sign operator ( '#' ), when used within a macro definition, converts a macro parameter into a string constant. This operator may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The token-pasting operator (##) within a macro definition combines two arguments. It permits two separate tokens in the macro definition to be joined into a single token. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It happened so because this example results in the following actual output from the preprocessor  
This example shows the concatenation of token##n into token34 and here we have used both stringize and token-pasting.
The preprocessor defined operator is used in constant expressions to determine if an identifier is defined using #define. If the specified identifier is defined, the value is true (non-zero). If the symbol is not defined, the value is false (zero). The defined operator is specified as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Parameterized Macros
One of the powerful functions of the CPP is the ability to simulate functions using parameterized macros. For example, we might have some code to square a number as follows  
We can rewrite above the code using a macro as follows  
Macros with arguments must be defined using the #define directive before they can be used. The argument list is enclosed in parentheses and must immediately follow the macro name. Spaces are not allowed between the macro name and open parenthesis. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.
You request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing directive #include, like you have seen inclusion of stdio.h header file, which comes along with your compiler.
Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file but we do not do it because it will be error-prone and it is not a good idea to copy the content of a header file in the source files, especially if we have multiple source files in a program.
A simple practice in C or C++ programs is that we keep all the constants, macros, system wide global variables, and function prototypes in the header files and include that header file wherever it is required.
Include Syntax
Both the user and the system header files are included using the preprocessing directive #include. It has the following two forms  
This form is used for system header files. It searches for a file named 'file' in a standard list of system directories. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
This form is used for header files of your own program. It searches for a file named 'file' in the directory containing the current file. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
Include Operation
The #include directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the current source file. The output from the preprocessor contains the output already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the #include directive. For example, if you have a header file header.h as follows  
and a main program called program.c that uses the header file, like this  
the compiler will see the same token stream as it would if program.c read.
Once-Only Headers
If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process its contents twice and it will result in an error. The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real contents of the file in a conditional, like this  
This construct is commonly known as a wrapper #ifndef. When the header is included again, the conditional will be false, because HEADER_FILE is defined. The preprocessor will skip over the entire contents of the file, and the compiler will not see it twice.
Computed Includes
Sometimes it is necessary to select one of the several different header files to be included into your program. For instance, they might specify configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating systems. You could do this with a series of conditionals as follows  
But as it grows, it becomes tedious, instead the preprocessor offers the ability to use a macro for the header name. This is called a computed include. Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument of #include, you simply put a macro name there  
SYSTEM_H will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for system_1.h as if the #include had been written that way originally. SYSTEM_H could be defined by your Makefile with a -D option.

Converting one datatype into another is known as type casting or, type-conversion. For example, if you want to store a 'long' value into a simple integer then you can type cast 'long' to 'int'. You can convert the values from one type to another explicitly using the cast operator as follows  
Consider the following example where the cast operator causes the division of one integer variable by another to be performed as a floating-point operation  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It should be noted here that the cast operator has precedence over division, so the value of sum is first converted to type double and finally it gets divided by count yielding a double value.
Type conversions can be implicit which is performed by the compiler automatically, or it can be specified explicitly through the use of the cast operator. It is considered good programming practice to use the cast operator whenever type conversions are necessary.
Integer Promotion
Integer promotion is the process by which values of integer type "smaller" than int or unsigned int are converted either to int or unsigned int. Consider an example of adding a character with an integer  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, the value of sum is 116 because the compiler is doing integer promotion and converting the value of 'c' to ASCII before performing the actual addition operation.
Usual Arithmetic Conversion
The usual arithmetic conversions are implicitly performed to cast their values to a common type. The compiler first performs integer promotion; if the operands still have different types, then they are converted to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy  
The usual arithmetic conversions are not performed for the assignment operators, nor for the logical operators && and ||. Let us take the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, it is simple to understand that first c gets converted to integer, but as the final value is double, usual arithmetic conversion applies and the compiler converts i and c into 'float' and adds them yielding a 'float' result.

As such, C programming does not provide direct support for error handling but being a system programming language, it provides you access at lower level in the form of return values. Most of the C or even Unix function calls return -1 or NULL in case of any error and set an error code errno. It is set as a global variable and indicates an error occurred during any function call. You can find various error codes defined in <error.h> header file.
So a C programmer can check the returned values and can take appropriate action depending on the return value. It is a good practice, to set errno to 0 at the time of initializing a program. A value of 0 indicates that there is no error in the program.
errno, perror(). and strerror()
The C programming language provides perror() and strerror() functions which can be used to display the text message associated with errno.
The perror() function displays the string you pass to it, followed by a colon, a space, and then the textual representation of the current errno value.
The strerror() function, which returns a pointer to the textual representation of the current errno value.
Let's try to simulate an error condition and try to open a file which does not exist. Here I'm using both the functions to show the usage, but you can use one or more ways of printing your errors. Second important point to note is that you should use stderr file stream to output all the errors.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Divide by Zero Errors
It is a common problem that at the time of dividing any number, programmers do not check if a divisor is zero and finally it creates a runtime error.
The code below fixes this by checking if the divisor is zero before dividing  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Program Exit Status
It is a common practice to exit with a value of EXIT_SUCCESS in case of program coming out after a successful operation. Here, EXIT_SUCCESS is a macro and it is defined as 0.
If you have an error condition in your program and you are coming out then you should exit with a status EXIT_FAILURE which is defined as -1. So let's write above program as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.
The C programming language supports recursion, i.e., a function to call itself. But while using recursion, programmers need to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.
Recursive functions are very useful to solve many mathematical problems, such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.
Number Factorial
The following example calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Fibonacci Series
The following example generates the Fibonacci series for a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Sometimes, you may come across a situation, when you want to have a function, which can take variable number of arguments, i.e., parameters, instead of predefined number of parameters. The C programming language provides a solution for this situation and you are allowed to define a function which can accept variable number of parameters based on your requirement. The following example shows the definition of such a function.
It should be noted that the function func() has its last argument as ellipses, i.e. three dotes (...) and the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the total number variable arguments passed. To use such functionality, you need to make use of stdarg.h header file which provides the functions and macros to implement the functionality of variable arguments and follow the given steps  
Define a function with its last parameter as ellipses and the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the number of arguments.
Create a va_list type variable in the function definition. This type is defined in stdarg.h header file.
Use int parameter and va_start macro to initialize the va_list variable to an argument list. The macro va_start is defined in stdarg.h header file.
Use va_arg macro and va_list variable to access each item in argument list.
Use a macro va_end to clean up the memory assigned to va_list variable.
Now let us follow the above steps and write down a simple function which can take the variable number of parameters and return their average  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result. It should be noted that the function average() has been called twice and each time the first argument represents the total number of variable arguments being passed. Only ellipses will be used to pass variable number of arguments.

This chapter explains dynamic memory management in C. The C programming language provides several functions for memory allocation and management. These functions can be found in the <stdlib.h> header file.
void *calloc(int num, int size);
This function allocates an array of num elements each of which size in bytes will be size.
void free(void *address);
This function releases a block of memory block specified by address.
void *malloc(size_t size);
This function allocates an array of num bytes and leave them uninitialized.
void *realloc(void *address, int newsize);
This function re-allocates memory extending it upto newsize.
Allocating Memory Dynamically
While programming, if you are aware of the size of an array, then it is easy and you can define it as an array. For example, to store a name of any person, it can go up to a maximum of 100 characters, so you can define something as follows  
But now let us consider a situation where you have no idea about the length of the text you need to store, for example, you want to store a detailed description about a topic. Here we need to define a pointer to character without defining how much memory is required and later, based on requirement, we can allocate memory as shown in the below example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result.
Same program can be written using calloc(); only thing is you need to replace malloc with calloc as follows  
So you have complete control and you can pass any size value while allocating memory, unlike arrays where once the size defined, you cannot change it.
Resizing and Releasing Memory
When your program comes out, operating system automatically release all the memory allocated by your program but as a good practice when you are not in need of memory anymore then you should release that memory by calling the function free().
Alternatively, you can increase or decrease the size of an allocated memory block by calling the function realloc(). Let us check the above program once again and make use of realloc() and free() functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result.
You can try the above example without re-allocating extra memory, and strcat() function will give an error due to lack of available memory in description.

It is possible to pass some values from the command line to your C programs when they are executed. These values are called command line arguments and many times they are important for your program especially when you want to control your program from outside instead of hard coding those values inside the code.
The command line arguments are handled using main() function arguments where argc refers to the number of arguments passed, and argv[] is a pointer array which points to each argument passed to the program. Following is a simple example which checks if there is any argument supplied from the command line and take action accordingly  
When the above code is compiled and executed with single argument, it produces the following result.
When the above code is compiled and executed with a two arguments, it produces the following result.
When the above code is compiled and executed without passing any argument, it produces the following result.
It should be noted that argv[0] holds the name of the program itself and argv[1] is a pointer to the first command line argument supplied, and *argv[n] is the last argument. If no arguments are supplied, argc will be one, and if you pass one argument then argc is set at 2.
You pass all the command line arguments separated by a space, but if argument itself has a space then you can pass such arguments by putting them inside double quotes "" or single quotes ''. Let us re-write above example once again where we will print program name and we also pass a command line argument by putting inside double quotes  
When the above code is compiled and executed with a single argument separated by space but inside double quotes, it produces the following result.

C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons

Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.
Why use C?
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be  
C Programs
A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write source code inside a program file.

If you want to set up your environment for C programming language, you need the following two software tools available on your computer, (a) Text Editor and (b) The C Compiler.
Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows, and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as on Linux or UNIX.
The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
The C Compiler
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be "compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
The following section explains how to install GNU C/C++ compiler on various OS. We keep mentioning C/C++ together because GNU gcc compiler works for both C and C++ programming languages.
Installation on UNIX/Linux
If you are using Linux or UNIX, then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line  
If you have GNU compiler installed on your machine, then it should print a message as follows  
If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
This tutorial has been written based on Linux and all the given examples have been compiled on the Cent OS flavor of the Linux system.
Installation on Mac OS
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use GNU compiler for C/C++.
Xcode is currently available at developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/.
Installation on Windows
To install GCC on Windows, you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage,  www.mingw.org, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program, which should be named MinGW-<version>.exe.
While installing Min GW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.
Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your PATH environment variable, so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.
After the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.

Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.
Hello World Example
A C program basically consists of the following parts  
Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World"  
Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program  
The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
The next line int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.
The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.
Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps  
Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
Save the file as hello.c
Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.
Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.
Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.

You have seen the basic structure of a C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the C programming language.
Tokens in C
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens  
The individual tokens are  
Semicolons
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
Given below are two different statements  
Comments
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below  
You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.
Identifiers
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers  
Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
Whitespace in C
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement  
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement  
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.
The types in C can be classified as follows  
Basic Types
They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.
Enumerated types
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
The type void
The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.
The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
Integer Types
The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges  
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof operator. The expressions sizeof(type) yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
Floating-Point Types
The following table provide the details of standard floating-point types with storage sizes and value ranges and their precision  
The header file float.h defines macros that allow you to use these values and other details about the binary representation of real numbers in your programs. The following example prints the storage space taken by a float type and its range values  
When you compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result on Linux  
The void Type
The void type specifies that no value is available. It is used in three kinds of situations  
Function returns as void
There are various functions in C which do not return any value or you can say they return void. A function with no return value has the return type as void. For example, void exit (int status);
Function arguments as void
There are various functions in C which do not accept any parameter. A function with no parameter can accept a void. For example, int rand(void);
Pointers to void
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type. For example, a memory allocation function void *malloc( size_t size ); returns a pointer to void which can be casted to any data type.

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic types explained in the previous chapter, there will be the following basic variable types  
char
Typically a single octet(one byte). It is an integer type.
int
The most natural size of integer for the machine.
float
A single-precision floating point value.
double
A double-precision floating point value.
void
Represents the absence of type.
C programming language also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like Enumeration, Pointer, Array, Structure, Union, etc. For this chapter, let us study only basic variable types.
Variable Definition in C
A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows  
Here, type must be a valid C data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool, or any user-defined object; and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here  
The line int i, j, k; declares and defines the variables i, j, and k;  which instruct the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows  
Some examples are  
For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables are undefined.
Variable Declaration in C
A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use the  keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.
Try the following example, where variables have been declared at the top, but they have been defined and initialized inside the main function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example  
Lvalues and Rvalues in C
There are two kinds of expressions in C  
lvalue   Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.
rvalue   The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.
Variables are lvalues and so they may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. Numeric literals are rvalues and so they may not be assigned and cannot appear on the left-hand side. Take a look at the following valid and invalid statements

Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are enumeration constants as well.
Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
Integer Literals
An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant. A prefix specifies the base or radix: 0x or 0X for hexadecimal, 0 for octal, and nothing for decimal.
An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for unsigned and long, respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order.
Here are some examples of integer literals  
Following are other examples of various types of integer literals  
Floating-point Literals
A floating-point literal has an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part. You can represent floating point literals either in decimal form or exponential form.
While representing decimal form, you must include the decimal point, the exponent, or both; and while representing exponential form, you must include the integer part, the fractional part, or both. The signed exponent is introduced by e or E.
Here are some examples of floating-point literals  
Character Constants
Character literals are enclosed in single quotes, e.g., 'x' can be stored in a simple variable of char type.
A character literal can be a plain character (e.g., 'x'), an escape sequence (e.g., '\t'), or a universal character (e.g., '\u02C0').
There are certain characters in C that represent special meaning when preceded by a backslash for example, newline (\n) or tab (\t).
Following is the example to show a few escape sequence characters  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
String Literals
String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes "". A string contains characters that are similar to character literals: plain characters, escape sequences, and universal characters.
You can break a long line into multiple lines using string literals and separating them using white spaces.
Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
Defining Constants
There are two simple ways in C to define constants  
Using #define preprocessor.
Using const keyword.
The #define Preprocessor
Given below is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The const Keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows  
The following example explains it in detail  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS.

A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program  
The auto Storage Class
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.
The example above defines two variables with in the same storage class. 'auto' can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.
The register Storage Class
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can't have the unary '&' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.
The static Storage Class
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.
In C programming, when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The extern Storage Class
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.
When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will also be used in other files, then extern will be used in another file to provide the reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding, extern is used to declare a global variable or function  in another file.
The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.
First File: main.c
Second File: support.c
Here, extern is being used to declare count in the second file, where as it has its definition in the first file, main.c. Now, compile these two files as follows  
It will produce the executable program a.out. When this program is executed, it produces the following result

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators  
We will, in this chapter, look into the way each operator works.
Arithmetic Operators
The following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by the C language. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Relational Operators
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C. Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20 then  
Show Examples
Logical Operators
Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then  
Show Examples
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &, |, and ^ is as follows  
Assume A = 60 and B = 13 in binary format, they will be as follows  
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101
-----------------
A&B = 0000 1100
A|B = 0011 1101
A^B = 0011 0001
~A = 1100 0011
The following table lists the bitwise operators supported by C. Assume variable 'A' holds 60 and variable 'B' holds 13, then  
Show Examples
Assignment Operators
The following table lists the assignment operators supported by the C language  
Show Examples
Misc Operators &map sizeof & ternary
Besides the operators discussed above, there are a few other important operators including sizeof and ? : supported by the C Language.
Show Examples
Operators Precedence in C
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.
For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.
Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages  
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.
C programming language provides the following types of decision making statements.
An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
You can use one switch statement inside another switch statement(s).
The ? : Operator
We have covered conditional operator ? : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form  
Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
The value of a ? expression is determined like this  
Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression.
If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.

You may encounter situations, when a block of code needs to be executed several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages  
C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
It is more like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
You can use one or more loops inside any other while, for, or do..while loop.
Loop Control Statements
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
C supports the following control statements.
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
Transfers control to the labeled statement.
The Infinite Loop
A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.
When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
NOTE   You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
Defining a Function
The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows  
A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function  
Return Type   A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.
Function Name   This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
Parameters   A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.
Function Body   The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
Example
Given below is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum value between the two  
Function Declarations
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.
A function declaration has the following parts  
For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows  
Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration  
Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.
Calling a Function
While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.
To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then you can store the returned value. For example  
We have kept max() along with main() and compiled the source code. While running the final executable, it would produce the following result  
Function Arguments
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.
While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function  
This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.
This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.
By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and beyond that variable it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C programming language  
Inside a function or a block which is called local variables.
Outside of all functions which is called global variables.
In the definition of function parameters which are called formal parameters.
Let us understand what are local and global variables, and formal parameters.
Local Variables
Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. The following  example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b, and c are local to main() function.
Global Variables
Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.
A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.
A program can have same name for local and global variables but the value of local variable inside a function will take preference. Here is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Formal Parameters
Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables. Following is an example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Initializing Local and Global Variables
When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized  by the system, you must initialize it yourself. Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows  
It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their memory location.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.
Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.
All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
Declaring Arrays
To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows  
This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement  
Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
Initializing Arrays
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows  
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].
If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write  
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array  
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above  
Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example  
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Arrays in Detail
Arrays are important to C and should need a lot more attention. The following important concepts related to array should be clear to a C programmer  
C supports multidimensional arrays. The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array.
You can pass to the function a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.
C allows a function to return an array.
You can generate a pointer to the first element of an array by simply specifying the array name, without any index.

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.
As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is  
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations  
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.
How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.
To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement as follows  
Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer  
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
The following declaration and initialization create a string consisting of the word "Hello". To hold the null character at the end of the array, the size of the character array containing the string is one more than the number of characters in the word "Hello."
If you follow the rule of array initialization then you can write the above statement as follows  
Following is the memory presentation of the above defined string in C/C++  
Actually, you do not place the null character at the end of a string constant. The C compiler automatically places the '\0' at the end of the string when it initializes the array. Let us try to print the above mentioned string  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
C supports a wide range of functions that manipulate null-terminated strings  
strcpy(s1, s2);
Copies string s2 into string s1.
strcat(s1, s2);
Concatenates string s2 onto the end of string s1.
strlen(s1);
Returns the length of string s1.
strcmp(s1, s2);
Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are the same; less than 0 if s1<s2; greater than 0 if s1>s2.
strchr(s1, ch);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character ch in string s1.
strstr(s1, s2);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of string s2 in string s1.
The following example uses some of the above-mentioned functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.
Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book  
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows  
The structure tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would declare the Book structure  
Accessing Structure Members
To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type. The following example shows how to use a structure in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Structures as Function Arguments
You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Pointers to Structures
You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable  
Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follows  
To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the   operator as follows  
Let us re-write the above example using structure pointer.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Fields
Bit Fields allow the packing of data in a structure. This is especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include  
Packing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.
Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be read in, e.g., 9-bit integers.
C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example  
Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.
C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.

A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
Defining a Union
To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows  
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str  
Now, a variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.
The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union. For example, in the above example, Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by a character string. The following example displays the total memory size occupied by the above union  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Accessing Union Members
To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword union to define variables of union type. The following example shows how to use unions in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, we can see that the values of i and f members of union got corrupted because the final value assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the value of str member is getting printed very well.
Now let's look into the same example once again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having unions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, all the members are getting printed very well because one member is being used at a time.

Suppose your C program contains a number of TRUE/FALSE variables grouped in a structure called status, as follows  
This structure requires 8 bytes of memory space but in actual, we are going to store either 0 or 1 in each of the variables. The C programming language offers a better way to utilize the memory space in such situations.
If you are using such variables inside a structure then you can define the width of a variable which tells the C compiler that you are going to use only those number of bytes. For example, the above structure can be re-written as follows  
The above structure requires 4 bytes of memory space for status variable, but only 2 bits will be used to store the values.
If you will use up to 32 variables each one with a width of 1 bit, then also the status structure will use 4 bytes. However as soon as you have 33 variables, it will allocate the next slot of the memory and it will start using 8 bytes. Let us check the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Bit Field Declaration
The declaration of a bit-field has the following form inside a structure  
The following table describes the variable elements of a bit field  
type
An integer type that determines how a bit-field's value is interpreted. The type may be int, signed int, or unsigned int.
member_name
The name of the bit-field.
width
The number of bits in the bit-field. The width must be less than or equal to the bit width of the specified type.
The variables defined with a predefined width are called bit fields. A bit field can hold more than a single bit; for example, if you need a variable to store a value from 0 to 7, then you can define a bit field with a width of 3 bits as follows  
The above structure definition instructs the C compiler that the age variable is going to use only 3 bits to store the value. If you try to use more than 3 bits, then it will not allow you to do so. Let us try the following example  
When the above code is compiled it will compile with a warning and when executed, it produces the following result

The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers  
After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example..
By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows  
You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
typedef vs #define
#define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences  
typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
The following example shows how to use #define in a program  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.
All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important preprocessor directives  
#define
Substitutes a preprocessor macro.
#include
Inserts a particular header from another file.
#undef
Undefines a preprocessor macro.
#ifdef
Returns true if this macro is defined.
#ifndef
Returns true if this macro is not defined.
#if
Tests if a compile time condition is true.
#else
The alternative for #if.
#elif
#else and #if in one statement.
#endif
Ends preprocessor conditional.
#error
Prints error message on stderr.
#pragma
Issues special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method.
Preprocessors Examples
Analyze the following examples to understand various directives.
This directive tells the CPP to replace instances of MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH with 20. Use #define for constants to increase readability.
These directives tell the CPP to get stdio.h from System Libraries and add the text to the current source file. The next line tells CPP to get myheader.h from the local directory and add the content to the current source file.
It tells the CPP to undefine existing FILE_SIZE and define it as 42.
It tells the CPP to define MESSAGE only if MESSAGE isn't already defined.
It tells the CPP to process the statements enclosed if DEBUG is defined. This is useful if you pass the -DDEBUG flag to the gcc compiler at the time of compilation. This will define DEBUG, so you can turn debugging on and off on the fly during compilation.
Predefined Macros
ANSI C defines a number of macros. Although each one is available for use in programming, the predefined macros should not be directly modified.
__DATE__
The current date as a character literal in "MMM DD YYYY" format.
__TIME__
The current time as a character literal in "HH:MM:SS" format.
__FILE__
This contains the current filename as a string literal.
__LINE__
This contains the current line number as a decimal constant.
__STDC__
Defined as 1 when the compiler complies with the ANSI standard.
Let's try the following example  
When the above code in a file test.c is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Preprocessor Operators
The C preprocessor offers the following operators to help create macros  
A macro is normally confined to a single line. The macro continuation operator (\) is used to continue a macro that is too long for a single line. For example  
The stringize or number-sign operator ( '#' ), when used within a macro definition, converts a macro parameter into a string constant. This operator may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
The token-pasting operator (##) within a macro definition combines two arguments. It permits two separate tokens in the macro definition to be joined into a single token. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It happened so because this example results in the following actual output from the preprocessor  
This example shows the concatenation of token##n into token34 and here we have used both stringize and token-pasting.
The preprocessor defined operator is used in constant expressions to determine if an identifier is defined using #define. If the specified identifier is defined, the value is true (non-zero). If the symbol is not defined, the value is false (zero). The defined operator is specified as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Parameterized Macros
One of the powerful functions of the CPP is the ability to simulate functions using parameterized macros. For example, we might have some code to square a number as follows  
We can rewrite above the code using a macro as follows  
Macros with arguments must be defined using the #define directive before they can be used. The argument list is enclosed in parentheses and must immediately follow the macro name. Spaces are not allowed between the macro name and open parenthesis. For example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.
You request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing directive #include, like you have seen inclusion of stdio.h header file, which comes along with your compiler.
Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file but we do not do it because it will be error-prone and it is not a good idea to copy the content of a header file in the source files, especially if we have multiple source files in a program.
A simple practice in C or C++ programs is that we keep all the constants, macros, system wide global variables, and function prototypes in the header files and include that header file wherever it is required.
Include Syntax
Both the user and the system header files are included using the preprocessing directive #include. It has the following two forms  
This form is used for system header files. It searches for a file named 'file' in a standard list of system directories. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
This form is used for header files of your own program. It searches for a file named 'file' in the directory containing the current file. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.
Include Operation
The #include directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the current source file. The output from the preprocessor contains the output already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the #include directive. For example, if you have a header file header.h as follows  
and a main program called program.c that uses the header file, like this  
the compiler will see the same token stream as it would if program.c read.
Once-Only Headers
If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process its contents twice and it will result in an error. The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real contents of the file in a conditional, like this  
This construct is commonly known as a wrapper #ifndef. When the header is included again, the conditional will be false, because HEADER_FILE is defined. The preprocessor will skip over the entire contents of the file, and the compiler will not see it twice.
Computed Includes
Sometimes it is necessary to select one of the several different header files to be included into your program. For instance, they might specify configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating systems. You could do this with a series of conditionals as follows  
But as it grows, it becomes tedious, instead the preprocessor offers the ability to use a macro for the header name. This is called a computed include. Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument of #include, you simply put a macro name there  
SYSTEM_H will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for system_1.h as if the #include had been written that way originally. SYSTEM_H could be defined by your Makefile with a -D option.

Converting one datatype into another is known as type casting or, type-conversion. For example, if you want to store a 'long' value into a simple integer then you can type cast 'long' to 'int'. You can convert the values from one type to another explicitly using the cast operator as follows  
Consider the following example where the cast operator causes the division of one integer variable by another to be performed as a floating-point operation  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
It should be noted here that the cast operator has precedence over division, so the value of sum is first converted to type double and finally it gets divided by count yielding a double value.
Type conversions can be implicit which is performed by the compiler automatically, or it can be specified explicitly through the use of the cast operator. It is considered good programming practice to use the cast operator whenever type conversions are necessary.
Integer Promotion
Integer promotion is the process by which values of integer type "smaller" than int or unsigned int are converted either to int or unsigned int. Consider an example of adding a character with an integer  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, the value of sum is 116 because the compiler is doing integer promotion and converting the value of 'c' to ASCII before performing the actual addition operation.
Usual Arithmetic Conversion
The usual arithmetic conversions are implicitly performed to cast their values to a common type. The compiler first performs integer promotion; if the operands still have different types, then they are converted to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy  
The usual arithmetic conversions are not performed for the assignment operators, nor for the logical operators && and ||. Let us take the following example to understand the concept  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Here, it is simple to understand that first c gets converted to integer, but as the final value is double, usual arithmetic conversion applies and the compiler converts i and c into 'float' and adds them yielding a 'float' result.

As such, C programming does not provide direct support for error handling but being a system programming language, it provides you access at lower level in the form of return values. Most of the C or even Unix function calls return -1 or NULL in case of any error and set an error code errno. It is set as a global variable and indicates an error occurred during any function call. You can find various error codes defined in <error.h> header file.
So a C programmer can check the returned values and can take appropriate action depending on the return value. It is a good practice, to set errno to 0 at the time of initializing a program. A value of 0 indicates that there is no error in the program.
errno, perror(). and strerror()
The C programming language provides perror() and strerror() functions which can be used to display the text message associated with errno.
The perror() function displays the string you pass to it, followed by a colon, a space, and then the textual representation of the current errno value.
The strerror() function, which returns a pointer to the textual representation of the current errno value.
Let's try to simulate an error condition and try to open a file which does not exist. Here I'm using both the functions to show the usage, but you can use one or more ways of printing your errors. Second important point to note is that you should use stderr file stream to output all the errors.
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Divide by Zero Errors
It is a common problem that at the time of dividing any number, programmers do not check if a divisor is zero and finally it creates a runtime error.
The code below fixes this by checking if the divisor is zero before dividing  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Program Exit Status
It is a common practice to exit with a value of EXIT_SUCCESS in case of program coming out after a successful operation. Here, EXIT_SUCCESS is a macro and it is defined as 0.
If you have an error condition in your program and you are coming out then you should exit with a status EXIT_FAILURE which is defined as -1. So let's write above program as follows  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.
The C programming language supports recursion, i.e., a function to call itself. But while using recursion, programmers need to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.
Recursive functions are very useful to solve many mathematical problems, such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.
Number Factorial
The following example calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result  
Fibonacci Series
The following example generates the Fibonacci series for a given number using a recursive function  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result

Sometimes, you may come across a situation, when you want to have a function, which can take variable number of arguments, i.e., parameters, instead of predefined number of parameters. The C programming language provides a solution for this situation and you are allowed to define a function which can accept variable number of parameters based on your requirement. The following example shows the definition of such a function.
It should be noted that the function func() has its last argument as ellipses, i.e. three dotes (...) and the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the total number variable arguments passed. To use such functionality, you need to make use of stdarg.h header file which provides the functions and macros to implement the functionality of variable arguments and follow the given steps  
Define a function with its last parameter as ellipses and the one just before the ellipses is always an int which will represent the number of arguments.
Create a va_list type variable in the function definition. This type is defined in stdarg.h header file.
Use int parameter and va_start macro to initialize the va_list variable to an argument list. The macro va_start is defined in stdarg.h header file.
Use va_arg macro and va_list variable to access each item in argument list.
Use a macro va_end to clean up the memory assigned to va_list variable.
Now let us follow the above steps and write down a simple function which can take the variable number of parameters and return their average  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result. It should be noted that the function average() has been called twice and each time the first argument represents the total number of variable arguments being passed. Only ellipses will be used to pass variable number of arguments.

This chapter explains dynamic memory management in C. The C programming language provides several functions for memory allocation and management. These functions can be found in the <stdlib.h> header file.
void *calloc(int num, int size);
This function allocates an array of num elements each of which size in bytes will be size.
void free(void *address);
This function releases a block of memory block specified by address.
void *malloc(size_t size);
This function allocates an array of num bytes and leave them uninitialized.
void *realloc(void *address, int newsize);
This function re-allocates memory extending it upto newsize.
Allocating Memory Dynamically
While programming, if you are aware of the size of an array, then it is easy and you can define it as an array. For example, to store a name of any person, it can go up to a maximum of 100 characters, so you can define something as follows  
But now let us consider a situation where you have no idea about the length of the text you need to store, for example, you want to store a detailed description about a topic. Here we need to define a pointer to character without defining how much memory is required and later, based on requirement, we can allocate memory as shown in the below example  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result.
Same program can be written using calloc(); only thing is you need to replace malloc with calloc as follows  
So you have complete control and you can pass any size value while allocating memory, unlike arrays where once the size defined, you cannot change it.
Resizing and Releasing Memory
When your program comes out, operating system automatically release all the memory allocated by your program but as a good practice when you are not in need of memory anymore then you should release that memory by calling the function free().
Alternatively, you can increase or decrease the size of an allocated memory block by calling the function realloc(). Let us check the above program once again and make use of realloc() and free() functions  
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result.
You can try the above example without re-allocating extra memory, and strcat() function will give an error due to lack of available memory in description.

It is possible to pass some values from the command line to your C programs when they are executed. These values are called command line arguments and many times they are important for your program especially when you want to control your program from outside instead of hard coding those values inside the code.
The command line arguments are handled using main() function arguments where argc refers to the number of arguments passed, and argv[] is a pointer array which points to each argument passed to the program. Following is a simple example which checks if there is any argument supplied from the command line and take action accordingly  
When the above code is compiled and executed with single argument, it produces the following result.
When the above code is compiled and executed with a two arguments, it produces the following result.
When the above code is compiled and executed without passing any argument, it produces the following result.
It should be noted that argv[0] holds the name of the program itself and argv[1] is a pointer to the first command line argument supplied, and *argv[n] is the last argument. If no arguments are supplied, argc will be one, and if you pass one argument then argc is set at 2.
You pass all the command line arguments separated by a space, but if argument itself has a space then you can pass such arguments by putting them inside double quotes "" or single quotes ''. Let us re-write above example once again where we will print program name and we also pass a command line argument by putting inside double quotes  
When the above code is compiled and executed with a single argument separated by space but inside double quotes, it produces the following result.
