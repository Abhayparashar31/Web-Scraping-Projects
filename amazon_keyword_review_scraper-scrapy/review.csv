,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Augmented Reality – Theory, Design & Development by Chetan G  Shetty  :  This book provides not only theoretical aspects of AR, but also math behind AR and sample AR code.  This is the best book, I have seen so far which provides theoretical, mathematical and also covers practical aspects of AR.  Starting from  AR History, this book covers Camera calibration, Computer coordinate system, representation of sequence of transformation using homogeneous matrix representation, Computer Vision, Hardware requirements to setup AR Lab, designing and developing AR applications. Best part of this book is basic concepts required to understand and develop AR applications.  It serves as a ready reckoner for the one who wants to develop AR applications.  It also covers OpenGL, OpenCV & ARprogramming toolkit.  This publication can be recommended as text book for AR.FromPushpa T SAssistant ProfessorDept of Computer ApplicationsBMSCE, Benagaluru-19"

All the available AR SDKs and tools have been explained in detail which makes it a good read for all the aspiring as well as experienced developers in this field.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would strongly recommend this book for any reader from a novice who wants to understand the basics of AR to an expert level who would be interested in various problems and solutions. The book is well written, facts captured in easily understandable and presented in an impressive manner."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good read for all the aspiring developers to understand AR. The pictorial representation of concepts by author makes it even more interesting to read and understand. The Book provides an insights with blend of theory and practical explanations on AR/VR. Overall, Great work by Author."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The language used in this book is unnecessarily complex, sometimes it feels like authors have just copy-pasted sentences from some reference book of statistics. e.g. ""Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning inspired by behaviorist psychology, concerned with how software agents ought to take action in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward"". In professional life we have no time to interpret or understand words like 'behaviorist', 'software agent' and 'notion of cumulative reward'. This is not a layman's language. Students might mug such sentences and write as is in their university exam answer sheets and secure marks; but such language is not useful for professionals definitely."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,The book is a collection of techniques without any practical applications of ML
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent and easy to follow book for machine learning. Recommended to people getting started with machine learning.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm yet to read this book. But paper quality is very poor and letter printed are very light. Seems not from original book publisher, duplicated or copied on cheap paper & selling it as original."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"should be very helpful for students ..yes, the print is a bit light ,but contents are good ."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a good book. Major concepts missing
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice book
,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very basic book.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have never seen such a simple book with such a lucid language. Author has taken so much efforts to make it simple and we really appreciate it. Undoubtedly book will sell like a wonder and happy to see quality content from good author and world famous publisher.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am new to this area of ML and found this book simple and easy to understand. The examples are good and understandable
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The fastest way to learn machine learning. Get to the point very fast. I would highly recommend this book to any one who is low on patience to learn machine learning
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The cookbook approach is quite good for getting started with something
,2.0 out of 5 stars,Its a good book if you have just started in machine learning.  But it won't be of any help you want to get any indepth knowledge.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's an excellent book .have added a sample of the contents in the book.really usefull for a beginner in machine learning.a must have book.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good learning material
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an excellent book for beginners … and a good guide for practitioners
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If there is only one machine learning book that you can buy, buy this one."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I received book today with good condition. I am very much excited to start this book. I was looking for cook book on machine learning with python from some time. Thanks Happy Learning...
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is just amazing. It starts by defining a problem that anyone working with ML would face and then tells you the solution with code along with the explanation. I bought the Kindle version so I can have it with me all the time.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent book for machine learning. If you have basic knowledge in python then this book is going to help you a lot...short crisp and simple explanation.. just go for it
,1.0 out of 5 stars,This book gave me a headache. The author just assumes you know everything already from makefile to docker to jenkins.  This is no introduction.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great read! This eaxactly what I was looking for. If you need a get started guide to could AI, look no further.Although most of the information you can research yourself online (as some commenters have noted) getting this book will save you DAYS if not WEEKS of clicking arround and googling how to do something and messing up. For that alone is worth 10x the price for me.The explanations are clear and very easy to follow, at least for me. I have not stopped referring back to the book since I got it. It is a lot easier than going down the google rabbit hole, for what I need to do at work. You do need some experience coding and messing around with AI to get some of the concepts.Although the information may seem scattered, it is not actually, there are no transitions between explaining different platforms. That’s all! . Which is great! I don’t want to be reading fluff, just tell me what I need to know to get going.Overall I’m happy to have this resource."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great introduction to AWS and GCP.  A lot of explanations on all the tools that are available to work with both.  Plus some good python code to use.  Explains well how powerful Jupyter notebook is with some good examples.  Ties AI, ML and cloud applications all together."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enjoyed it from cover to cover. Great book for anyone looking for trends and pragmatic approaches to doing data science in the cloud. Will use as a reference as I build my toolkit!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pragmatic AI hits at the intersection of cloud, Python programming and AI.  This book will not help you earn your PHD in AI, but it will show you what it takes to get an AI workload into production using cutting edge cloud technology."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Read the first 35% of the book and nothing much you can take away from as the information is easily available freely on internet.  The author is more interested to tell you to use Amazon and Google platform for your AI or machine learning and merely listing their products URL.You could have easily visited Google and AWS website and read the user guides there without spending a dime
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is available online for free as pdf on Microsoft website but I wanted print copy. Book content is no doubt great but there are many issues with the printing which make me doubt it is a genuine book.Pros:1. Hardbound was available for 1500 during sale.2. Page quality is good, images and headings are colored.Cons:1. Table of content was misprinted2. Few pages have ink smudges while few are light3. Sometimes 2 consecutive pages have different shade.4. Way too many pages were joint showing poor publishing.Advice: Beware of new sellers who don't have much ratings and check full book as soon as you recieve it."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unstructured and chaotic information, useless diagrams, totally unreadable.Pretty weak book dont match the cover name."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Silky soft acid-free color papers. It feels good to read on this paper. Color print, if you were wondering btw!!"
,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's the same book from before. Nothing new about the 2020 publishing date. Inside the publishing date is 2006.UPDATE: After opening the book I found extremely bad formatting. Hence I returned it.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"PRML is a modern classic in machine learning. It's legally available online for free but I bought a hard copy of the book after I noticed that there's a heavy discount. It turns out that it might be available at a discount because the publisher is trying to get rid of copies that have some printing mistakes: some of the pages in the beginning are out of order and the colour printing is not great. But the book is still readable. The first copy I ordered had several torn pages as well but the seller replaced the book. Even then, the replaced copy had several pages which were printed out of sequence."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The book is fantastic though published  in 2006. No book on machine learning even today is so elaborate and in-depth. The author is really made a great effort to unleased the underlying concept in the all the topics covered in the book.It is a must have book.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,I got black and white print pages. Book quality is worse. No color pages. Text are not aligned.
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This isn't from original publishers. Some pages were mixed up, some pages were blurred. Some were cut unevenly. This is a pirated print. There is no sticker from publishers. Please do not buy."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Its locally printed copy. Index page is missplaced. Rest seems to be good.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"very good paper quality and printing, colored , silky soft pages...got from all india book house for 4200"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book....... Those who really want to learn and work in the field of Machine Learning should have this book.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is awesome but, it's freely available online.The only reason for buying this is to have a good paper printed version.However,The paper used for making this is of recycle quality and thus, I strongly believe printing it would be a far cost as well as quality efficient thing to do!Regards,Rishabh Jain"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"one of the best book for ML. I am from IIT Bombay and during my course of ML at IITB, my professor always used to refer this book."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Skips on a lot of important topics. The book tries to cover a lot of different areas and gives a rather jumpy feeling. I took it to my college and my friends had the same opinion as I. Returned it. If you are a newbie in the field of ML and looking for something that approaches the subject in a more step-by-step approach, this book is certainly not for you. Expert users who may wish to read only a few chapters may find it useful."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"PDF is free online but hard copies are always welcome. Good book to get started on ML as well. A little too much if you don't have a good math or CS background but otherwise for people working already in the industry, this can be used as a go to book to clear any doubts."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book covers a wide range of topics  It is a very good book for an overall idea of the subject and for an introductory course. The advantage is that each chapter has a section on ""Further Reading"" which has lists of more advanced material on each topic for those who want to learn the subject thoroughly and mathematically. Overall a very good book"
,3.0 out of 5 stars,Introductory book. One can get to know the basic ideas. However for serious work one has to refer to the machine learning literature.
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are starting with Machine Learning, this must not be your first ML book. The book tries to capture the essence of ML, algorithmic thinking and core of ML models. But it will not get you started. It is more of academic taste."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly I was disappointed with the quality of the paper used for printing. Keeping that aside the printing also is uneven. Some pages are printed and sliced unevenly. I have attached few images. Started to use this book. If any pages are missing, will update the review.But please try to print it properly or else atleast reduce the price of the book"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first machine learning text book after Andrew Ng course .the book provides good introductory machine learning algorithm along with proof like gradient descent, maximum likelihood principle which I found very useful along with pseudo code .definitely recommended to kick-start your journey as it is short book with less math and more intuition behind the algorithm which is very useful to get a foundation for further study."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cover the theoritical background of ML. Language is easy to comprehend. Good book and must have for ML
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It is just a collection of notes and codes that we keep in some random text file, just to resuse it in future. It doesn't give you in depth knowledge of whats and hows of things written in it. Or just maybe I expected something else from this and it turned out to be a simple book of codes.Anyways, it would have been easier just to create a github repo with proper readme files and all, instead of writing a whole book for it."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Data Scientist/ AI Engineer working for the last 3 years in the industry. This is my honest review -As the book name suggests this is the best book that you could get on practical machine learning and data science. The author has written the book with great dedication and the explanations at each section is amazing.I really liked the flow of the book, from basic concepts to covering images and text problems, advanced concepts like Entity embeddings and what not!The codes are written perfectly and in such a way that it develops a great habit of writing good quality code for any data scientist or enthusiast. The author has made sure that the code is reusable and can be taken into production.P.S. - Don’t think too much, just go ahead and buy it!!! It’s Amazing!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An oustanding book. What he claimed , it has been produced in the same fashion. It is a very very useful book for the machine learning aspirants and practicener both.Worth purchasing. Contents of the book are far beyond its cost.I recommend it will be worth purchasing . I assign five stars as very useful technics alogwith code etc have been provided so lucidly.The author seems to have taken a lot of efforts."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,This book can be a good reference material if you are starting to become a serious ML practitioner.But the book shies away from getting too deep into more hands on problems faced in ML projects. Or maybe I expect too much from the author.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The book is not compatible with a kindle paperwhite. I purchased the kindle edition on 8th July.Edit: Had doubts about the compatibility and got them cleared from the author himself. Don't want this review to hurt the author's reputation. I haven't read the book yet but I am sure it will be a brilliant read.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an hands on book and not a theory book as already mentioned by author.The points that make this book different1. Using comprehensive code with good explanation and all necessary comments2. Not using standard dataset like iris cars etc and utilising bigger Datasets from kaggle3. Touching almost everything that you encounter while building a model. Also adding on touching distributing your model using flask and docker4. Covers NLP too including transformers which many of starting ML books choose to ignore.For me it is a good reference guide if you want to brush up again and again.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading couple of chapters and have a look at the rest I feel that if someone wants to know how you can solve a machine learning problem with topics like feature selection, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization it's always better to code it and learn and see what's happening, and that's exactly what the author did. You will also get an idea about NLP models like BERT and how you can use docker, flask for deploying your ML model. What I miss in this book is, if it has a couple of chapters to show how to solve a particular problem statement/dataset by combining the topics he covered in the book, and from creating a baseline model to a pretty complex one just to show the end-to-end approach he usually takes to solve a machine learning problem. Just to ideate his thoughts and strategy he usually follows to solve when he gets an ML problem."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is freely downloadable from the authors website. I still ordered this book from 'saraswati pustakalaya'  at Rs 1700, because I wanted a hard copy. This book is great in terms of highlighting the mathematical prerequisites for Machine Learning. But to assume that this is a sufficient and all encompassing 'go to' book would be naive. The prerequisites of Multivariate Calculus, Probability, Linear Algebra and Statistics (Inferential) are vast bodies of knowledge themselves and all of them cannot just be compressed into this single book. This book identifies the specific topics from the prerequisites that are extensively used in building the foundation for the Machine-Learning theory. This is where it helps. I am not a formal mathematician, but I've studied 'Mathematical Statistics, so have some idea of the concepts.  Every ML enthusiast should have this book (free pdf or hard copy), but should have extra books on the 4 prerequisites. Once you are comfortable with the prerequisites, then this book would be helpful. If you are not comfortable with the prequisites then you should avoid this book. The book can be terse, because it is jamming 3 branches of Mathematics and Staistics into a single book. Hope this feedback helps others who are interested. PS - The hard copy that I got was published in India !! I had thought that it was a US print, but was pissed at seeing the 'Sale for only in India' logo. However, the page quality and print quality is excellent. I was amazed as I know Indian prints are pathetic. And the pages are colored, for an Indian print this is not common."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is exactly what it claims . It is approach to almost any kind of machine learning problem . The book has a very practical approach towards problem solving and has tones of code .  The book is intended to people who knows a bit of background and struggles to start problem solving .  The book was and is very helpful for me in day to day life and hence the 5 stars .I want to be clear in the review so that people dont get disappointed after buying the book or refrain from buying the book seeing few negative reviews .The book is  immensely helpful for senior professionals like me who are from other branches of software engineering /domain knowledge and still wants to reduce the entry level barrier to get into machine learning and deep learningThe book is immensely helpful for students from programming/non-programming background looking to learn and solve AI/ML problems and are scared to venture into it .The book is immensely helpful for people with a lot of theoretical knowledge but less programming knowledge to apply the same into some cool project .The book is not helpful for people who has a masters in mathematics and looking for reference in writing phd thesis in Machine Learning methods .
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazingly written in approaching any machine learning problem. I have seen and read lot of books which talks about all the algorithms (from mathematical to intuition point of view), but no one gave me a clear view on how we can approach any dataset and build good models from the data.  The flow of chapters are perfect and in the end you will learn a lot on building the ML models. I think it is a must book like how Tibshirani and Trevor's book (Introduction to Statistical Learning) is must for every beginner to pro. Thanks to Abhishek for writing this gem of a book. Looking forward for more of his works in the future on Deep learning & NLP."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this book yesterday. Already few pages into the book. Absolutely loving it so far. It's different than other books in the sense that it will be very helpful for budding machine learning enginners. This book helps you create a strong base of most the algorithms and shows how to code them on python. It doesn't have complicated equations of the algorithms, not that you don't need to know them, this book will create a great base for you to understand those complex equations and will clear your concepts on these algorithms. It also helps in understanding the implementation of different algorithms."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used the online copy of this book when going through the Math for ML specialisation in Coursera. It's pretty comprehensive in handling the core areas of Math required for ML. I'd also recommend it as a quick refresher in Math if you're preparing for ML/DS interviews. Had to get the physical copy, because it's much easier to navigate, and unlike other tech books this one is not to be obsolete anytime soon."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Given the price of the book, was expecting better paper quality and also colored diagrams. The diagrams are in black ink."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent material
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommend
,5.0 out of 5 stars,One and Only best book for mathematics needed to learn and understand the ML.The book summarizes all the topics needed. Really helpful
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I find it strange there are so many positive reviews for this book. Some of the reviewers have only this review to their name, which I always find dodgy. The presentation is turgid, dull and unclear. Not a pedagogical masterpiece by any means - neither fish nor fowl, the terse (as described by the authors themselves) mathematical syntax serves only to obfuscate, without being mathematical rigorous.I've made several attempts to read this (and I know much of the material already) but trying to decipher the unnecessarily quasi-mathematical notation that makes simple concepts unclear got too wearying. I've ordered Aggarwal's ""Linear Algebra and Optimization for Machine Learning"". I hope that's better."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"While the content of the book is very clear and concise (something many maths books tend to struggle with), this text unfortunately falls into the trap of presenting many new ideas with too few exercises to reinforce them (at least in the maths section). This would be fine if the authors' aim was to produce a reference for these topics, but they themselves acknowledge the intended target audience to be ""undergraduate students, evening learners and learners participating in online machine learning courses"" i.e. those who are being introduced to the subject matter for the first time and who will quickly forget these ideas after having struggled through the terse, potentially unfamiliar, language."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have just received this book hours ago. It is paperback.  I breezed through book with skimreading at first. Simple illustrations with few colours — VERY HELPFUL. The page layout is perfect, very easy on my eyes! I could read quickly, as the text is not too cluttered. I have learned maths fast. Thank you, authors.Moreover, I absolutely love the 4cm margins at the outer edges of pages, as I like pencilling my notes in blank spaces or place sticky notes there. Helpful footnotes in the margins."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a very good (and maybe only) resource for someone who's starting on the field of machine learning and is trying to understand the underlying mathematics.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you want to start Tensorflow then this best book. Actually this is same as Coursera Tensorflow developer Specialization course. I will highly recommend for Tensorflow introduction
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the practical nature and code first approach of the book. Concepts are explained enough for us to be able to understand their importance and use. I highly recommend this as the book to start learning Tensorflow with.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,It follows a code first approach. Though the concepts are explained decently to provide working knowledge it doesn't have the mathematical explanations. Code is well structured and explained in detail. Very good guide to get started with coding in tensorflow. The best part I liked was the Hyperparameter tuning with keras tuner being explained very well.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really helpful
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book will make you fall in love with reading again. Easy and must book for beginners as well as professional go for it .
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you like to learn new frameworks or technologies by tinkering with practical examples, this book is excellent.  It provides great coverage of data preparation and the creation, training, testing, and evaluation of models for computer vision, natural language, and time series data using Tensorflow and the Keras Sequential API."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"El contenido del libro es muy bueno para iniciarse en deep learning, pero no hay algún indicador de que el libro es escala de grises y no a color"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Doesn't get bogged down on minutiae but the examples are limited. You need to expand your experience gained from this book, and code other examples yourself. Very good template though"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Also check out the author GITHUB, some code has been already/fixed/improved in there."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tonight, I completed reading of Laurence Moroney’s book “AI and Machine Learning for Coders”. I enjoyed this book from cover to cover, and I am especially thankful for a few things.First, this book did a great job of explaining how tensorflow can be used to solve different types of problems, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. It even went into text generation, which got my creativity going.Second, this book is written for coders, but it does explain how neural networks work at a high level. It doesn’t drop a wall of math on the reader, which I appreciated. I feel much more comfortable now, after reading this.And finally, the book ends by discussing interpretability, bias/fairness, and Google’s AI principles. I found that to be a beautiful ending.I give this five stars. The few issues I had were trivial. This book is outstanding. I’m so much better off for having read it."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good book but still not study.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have read theoretical books on AI/ML; they do explain concepts but do not make you get started hands-on. This book does that. It has a few foundational chapters to cover the basics and then applies them either in R or Python. Note that you cannot be too naive in maths or understanding program flows if you intend to work in the area of AI/ML. Hence, it is good to have supplementary books on maths (basic statistics, matrix and probability) and general programming to quickly refer back. When I bought the book, thought that it is good to know two languages as well; but while reading it, felt a bit uncomfortable while switching from one example in one language to the other in another language; however, examples themselves are self-sufficient and comprehensible."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Book For Who Want's To Learn Machine Learning From Basics
,4.0 out of 5 stars,This book is perfect for newbies and for people with some knowledge about ML.It covers from basic to advanced topics. Plus the explanation is decent.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,good
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent book
,5.0 out of 5 stars,ok
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Being a ML practitioner and trainer, always wanted a single book to cover all nuances of machine learning. Found this while checked for new titles and this book is a very good read. Was able to finish the contents in 3 days(10 chapters) and the authors have done an excellent job to teach ML through this book. Highly recommended for beginners and new comers to machine learning."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,I am returning the book as it is not a printed book but a Xerox copy one. Even the back cover is not printed (copied) properly. Figures have Xerox marks.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ya it's a nice text book and some of the concepts are implemented  using R tool.This book explains the regression concepts very nicelyBut this book never explains the genetic programming, locally weighted regression,EM algorithm and Q learning etc"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very helpful book for any fresh Data Scientist or to be Data Scientist! It works as a novel and is quite interesting. I definitely recommend this book to all interested in the field.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The content is very good and simplified. Great book for beginners and intermediates in Machine Learning.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not so good. Topics are discussed in very Boring manure. Waste of money
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Regrading Content of book:Book is really good for beginers to understand Machine Learning.Quality of Material:Paper quality is not good
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I found language and content quite good as a beginner in machine learning. Could understand concepts really well
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Every topic is defined with introductory part and then elaborated with good explanations and I think money is worth spending. Five stars just for book.I didn't get the bill with it.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent book for Machine Learning.Quality of book is really good
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice Book. Exactly this is what you require to get you started on machine learning. Even after reading multiple theory books and watching Andrew's machine learning videos for nearly one year, I was not knowing how to actually put my knowledge into practice. After reading this book only, I was able to create ML models on my own and got a bit more comfortable in ML area. Trust me you don't need a masters to read and understand this book, but a bit of python knowledge helps."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The cover of the book, as shown in Amazon.in is different from the actual book cover.  What you will get is a grayscale edition of the original book which looks even worse than photocopy and the copy is only intended for sale in the Indian subcontinent.Nevertheless the book is a pretty good resourse for anyone who wants a head start in the field of ML with Python.  Pair it up with a good online course and you are good to go.Best of luck !"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book will always be in my shelf. This might not be the most organized book in machine learning but man this book has stuff. Along with convex optimisation and linear algebra this book gave me enough exposure to machine learning topics that I cleared research position in ml at good companies without sweat. This book is everything PRML by bishop is and more but with slightly hard to read organisation.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,It looks like a good book but it is more of reference book and not a text book. Could be a good one for Phd student.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice coverage of topics. Very nice explanation with detailed formula and fundamentals. Truly bridges the gap between classical statistics and machine learning
,5.0 out of 5 stars,1. It's not for faint hearted people who don't understand the beauty of mathematics.2. It covers almost all the topics of ML and a good handbook which covers Statistical Learning and Patterns Recognition.3. Heavy book both in terms of weight and knowledge too. The book is very poetic for ML.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money on this book. This book is junk. You will never learn anything from this book. Very superficial coverage of the topics and very very confusing. Better to pick up a math book instead.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,A book without bookmark should never be sold to a customer
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"1 This is the best ML book I can find, though, not very suitable for a beginner. There are many typos in the first 3 printings. The 4th (and later) printing is much better. What I bought (11/24/2017) is the 6th printing (the same as the 4th).2 Please note: The book mainly concentrate on various classic supervised and unsupervised learning methods, and not much on deep neural network (tons of materials online, e.g. youtube or tensorflow’s guide),and reinforcement learning (Sutton’s famous book).3 The following sentences are what I found on Quora, said by the author (2016): “…the current version is admittedly rather hard for beginners. I am actually in the process of writing the second edition, which will ramp up more slowly,  making it more accessible to beginners. (I'm also adding new content on deep learning, reinforcement learning, etc.) But it will take me a while to finish (~2 years?).”Before I bought it, I emailed the author to ask his plan on the 2nd edition. He said: “... I am working on it, but it won't be done till late 2018...”.4 Last but not least, the book binding is firm, and, beautiful :)"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is a good book for beginners which tells what is machine learning and some preliminary methods used in Machine Learning. Solved Numericals help in understanding concepts to the core
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst book
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A very good book, I use it as a reference, it explains briefly most machine learning algorithms clearly  and shows you a simple implementation.  Best to use to compliment a machine learning book of your choice, I’m using this in conjunction with Hands On Machine Learning With Scikit Learn and Tensor Flow."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are a practitioner of ML, I'd suggest you to buy this book with eyes closed. The author doesn't go extremely deep into the theory behind most of the algorithms, because well... that's not the primary focus of this book. It's more hands-on, as the title suggests, and I think the contents justify that pretty well. For a more comprehensive treatment to the theory behind the algorithms, I'd suggest to go with 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' or 'Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning'. Both are freely available online.I had the 1st edition of this book but still chose to buy this new and improved iteration mostly because of the following reasons.1.  Addition of new materials (e.g. more unsupervised learning, more deep net techniques, new CNN architectures, etc.)2. Migration of codebase to Tensorflow 2.0.3. Discussion on Training and Deployment of Tensorflow models at scale.This is a colored edition, unlike the 1st edition of the book. It helps immensely, especially for the visualizations and graphs. The page quality is very nice too, and they have a glossy finish."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my absolute favorite Machine Learning book.I might call it a reference book. Chris is not a programmer by heart (just a smart Ph.D.). So he does not try to solve problems with fancy code. I love that. You might not.To get the most of this book, allow me to give you some pointers:- Your favorite ML library is Scikit-Learn (i.e. you solve numerical/categorical problems).- You have some Kaggle experience (nominal, ordinal, categorical problems).- You have a strong foundation in ML, Python, statistics, Pandas you have gained from authors such as Sebastian Raschka, Wes McKinney, Jake VanderPlas, Jason Brownlee…My runner-ups:“Python Machine Learning” by Sebastian RaschkaComment: Anything written by Sebastian is amazing. A must read for Scikit-Learn Ninjas.“Hands on Machine Learning …” by Aurelien GeronComment: One of the most impressive ML books ever. It’s so much though material though. And Geron is beyond super-smart.“Data Science from Scratch” by Joel GrusComment: Intellectually, I love the topics, but don’t like his way of writing code. And, with many Data Science books in general, tries to cover simply too much.Highlights in “Machine Learning with Python Cookbook”:- Page >47: the best Panda tricks in a few pages.- Page 71: A popular Kaggle trick: labeling outliers in a separate column.- Page 77: not many understand how to deal with MCAR and MAR.- Page 78: data imputation. How to do it and when to use mean (normal distribution) and median.- Page >81: dealing with categorical data is hard. Many authors like to avoid it, not Chris.- Page 201: visualizing the effect of training set size. Great working code!Conclusion: a great reference book for us who are into Python, Pandas and Scikit-Learn (traditional Machine Learning algorithms)."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this book yesterday and I already finished two chapters. Here is a short summary of the content:- This is a very practical introduction to machine learning using Python.- I have some experience with ML concepts. Although the book says it's for beginners, I still find it helpful. The second chapter, end-to-end machine learning projects, helped me to understand a few small yet important steps we tend to miss/ignore when we work on a large scale ML project.- Choose this book if you know Python. Even if you don't have Python experience, with a crash course, you can easily learn Python and the concepts in the book.Now a little bit about the book: The book is of high quality! It is also a bit heavy due to the quality of the paper. All the pages are colored and glossy and attractive enough to make you wanna read the book!I recommend this to anyone with no/beginner/intermediate experience in ML."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had my eye on this since the author published the latest version earlier this year however I was skeptical regarding Shroff Publishers faithfully reproducing it and that too a full colour edition. Fortunately I was proven wrong as both, the paper quality itself and other aspects like font and coloured images were on point and precise.Regarding the content itself, this revised version of the book has been updated for Tensorflow 2.0 and latest version of the Keras API.As described, the book while ensuring it delivers a brief introduction behind the technical components of a machine learning project lifecycle and ideas; focuses primarily on the working of the tools and their respective capabilities with code snippets for most of the examples present explained throughout the book.Notebooks containing source code for all the described examples and case studies, are present on the authors public Github repository under 'handson-ml2'. Also includes the datasets utilized some of which are modified versions of other publicly available datasets.Do note that environment setup described is as according to a Linux and Mac based terminal. For Windows just like the author himself notes, I would highly suggest installing Anaconda (or Miniconda - lightweight bare bones installation of the same which I personally recommend and use). Once you have made a virtual environment and installed the required packages using conda package manager you can follow all the rest of the instructions in the book.Overall this handbook is highly recommended for anyone who is decently versed with Python and has a rough idea about what Machine Learning actually is because unfortunately there are a lot of buzzwords in the market involving the field of machine learning and data science, the latter of which is a much broader term.So if you are just starting out to explore this area I suggest beginning with some other resources which define and clarify some of the myths as you should know what you are actually getting into before fully investing your time. For learning the basics of Python itself, I personally suggest 'Byte of Python' which is a freely available ebook for a brief introduction to the language."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of the best books I have read in machine learning. With so many years in the Corporate world, I am out of touch with theoretical mathematics.  But reading this book never made me feel that I am out of touch with advanced maths as the explanations are crystal clear without the hassles of too much of mathematical jargons. I will always recommend this book to anyone who wants to start their ML journey."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So Finally I got the book at around 2000Rs. The other one was at 5000. I was confused about what is the difference between both, will this one be with tensorflow2x or it is the old one.This one is genuine and good quality colored printed pages. Covering all the topics and basics for Deep Learning and Machine learning. I have an iPad for reading books but I am more comfortable with folding pages and writing on paper rather than thinking about the battery when I need to study. So bought this one and looking forward to completing it.Costly but yeah worth being an OReilly Book.Thanks for reading."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's an Excellent Book on ML and that's a well known fact but the package is just pathetic. The first book arrived with corner damage and now the replacement received is an used Book. Lot of Folded pages used as marker. A book with 2200 rupees deserve a decent box packing and not just this Amazon cover. A 100 rupees worth Geometry Box is arriving in a Box Package whereas this book is just sold like this. Totally disappointed and not sure weather to raise a replacement again or just settle with it.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,Please review the table of contents before purchasing this book - Machine Learning chops until after a number of chapters.It does not look as easy as it looks - you will have to practice a ton before you can comfortably use these skills on a regular basis with a reasonable amount of precision - but I thoroughly enjoyed the gentle introduction topics.Overall a definite handbook to have in one's Data Science arsenal.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Maravilhoso. As explicações são muito boas e bem escritas. A proposta de testar o código copiando e colando e depois entender o processo é simples e deixa tudo muito melhor. Vale ressaltar que não é um livro introdutório, mas sim com soluções, como o título já indica."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,The book is amazing. Quality of book is worth the price. Thanks to Amazon for such quality packing. I would recommend this book to every aspiring data science folks out there. This book has good amount of information to start of with and do great projects in python. It has python coding in it. Which boosts up this book even more
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I found the contents of the book is merely compilation of material available on internet which is created and nicely explained by different experts on different machine learning topics. This book mainly explores features of sklearn library using pandas, seaborn and matplotlib. So, if you need compiled version of supervised and unsupervised algorithms implemented in python, then this book is a good choice. Authors also claims that ""All the topics include real-world examples and provide step-by-step approach..."". Please visit ""Kaggle: Your Home for Data Science"", you find everything there. Anyways, it also made me disappointed to see renowned publisher ""Wiley"" associated with it."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent book for data scientist new to Python. The book provides code examples on a variety of topics starting from probability distribution and many machine learning algorithms. The examples are well choosen and embibes the core concepts of data science and reflects years of teaching experience of both Prof Dinesh and Manaranjan.I highly recommend it as a reference book to look up for codes snippets while working on ML projects.

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to learn Python and amazon suggested me this book, but although it's really useful, this book isn't for beginners who are not aware of the basics of Python. The authors could have done a better job by providing scannable QR codes rather than providing the links for the data or placing all the materials in one folder rather than directing the user to download something from a different website for each exercise. I had a hard time finding IPL .csv file on the internet as even the link was not provided. The publishers should take care of these things from next time!"
,3.0 out of 5 stars,This book is helpful for those who are new in Machine Learning and are doing self study. But it requires a good knowledge of Python Programming where all the basic concepts are well versed.The main point for this book is exercises which are given after every chapter. I may be challenging for self learners as there are no solutions and one cannot gain confidence whether the solution or the way the solution is done is correct or not.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't spend your money on this book. It will not at all talk about basics for which a newbie struggles.It will directly write python code using various libraries without explaining the code. so you are expected to know pandas, matplotlib, seaborn etc. beforehand.I was somewhat fine with this because my main need from this book was to understand the stats involved with machine learning but it fails there as well.It will start talking about examples without explaining what normal distribution is, what is confidence interval and all.TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY, PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewing a book is always a very subjective matter. I already work on data sc. This book would give help me get quick tips.

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I found this book to be incredibly practical, easy-to-approach, and directly applicable to real-world problems that I am trying to solve. I have read quite a few Machine Learning (ML) and AI-type books ""for programmers"".  This book differs from them in having the sole focus of giving programmers the minimum, pertinent, focused information and context needed to start utilizing TensorFlow (TF) on their own projects, right now. There are enough examples in this book that one of them might directly address a problem you are contemplating using TF for.  If not, reading how to apply TF across these various scenarios is likely to enable you to try TF in your project.  I really like the ""results-driven"" organization of the chapters. This makes the book both a self-contained class in using TensorFlow as a developer, and a good ""cookbook"" for both using TensorFlow, and deploying TensorFlow models to alternate/resource-constrained devices (via TensorFlow Lite).  I heartily recommend this book for these purposes!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you start with this book, watch Laurence's videos on the TensorFlow/ Google Developer youtube channel and work all the examples and exercises, you will have a solid foundation in deep learning. Then you could potentially learn more from the documentation itself or by using Aurélien Géron's book.I feel other Oreilly books should be like this.Although math is almost absent in this book (hence 'for coders'), Laurence does a great job explaining convolutions and maxpooling etc.. I've seen lectures from many sources that misattribute pixel/dimension reduction to the convolution step and not the pooling layer (worse yet, lump both together) but the author clearly explains the concepts."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Laurence is the teacher you always wish you had.  He covers every aspect of TensorFlow with deep yet tangible intelligence.  If you're worried about understanding the practice of machine learning and artificial intelligence, don't worry any longer.  This book guides you through various aspects of the TensorFlow framework, but it also leans into the varying aspects of popular AI problems.You get the full tour in this book, from NLP coding to embedding your models in edge devices.  Each section is overflowing with code samples to help you solidify what you're learning.10 out of 10, a cornerstone of any AI bookshelf."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Laurence Moroney is an extremely gifted teacher with an uncanny ability to make optically complex tasks seem almost trivial.  For example, the chapters on time series analysis and sequencing models using AI are some of the clearest and most applicable examples that I've seen published so far (and forecasting is a very hot topic right now).  This book leverages Keras to demonstrate how some fairly astonishing things (image recognition, NLP, forecasting, etc) can happen with not that much code.  I almost think that this should be required reading for anyone concerned with AI explainability.  Thank you so much, Laurence Moroney."

It goes great with Columbia University's online course on Artificial Intelligence (CSMM.101X) and serves as a handy reference. This print for the Indian subcontinent seems genuine. The paper quality is better than what you'd expect and the cover is in good condition as well. The book is exceptionally heavy, mind you. Running 1150 or so pages, this tome might not be easy to accommodate in your bookshelf."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"although the book is very well written, but its quite elaborated in every point,so you just read a concept 2 times in different way.support your reading with the github repo available to get full out of this book.enjoy reading and stay focused !!"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want to kickstart  your journey in AI then look no further. This book lays the foundation and then build upon it. Almost no prerequisites required. A knowledge of freshman calculus would not hurt though. Overall ,a brilliant book and a must read for an AI enthusiast."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For someone interested in artificial intelligence , without any prior knowledge of the field , this is ""the best"" book to start with . Further in your study of advanced books on the subject you won't feel missing out on any critical basic information related to artificial intelligence. I love philosophical introduction to artificial intelligence ,the most about this book ."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Started reading book, don't know much but it seems interesting. Paper quality of indian edition is very poor. BTW, book is too big. It'll take a very long time to understand.Giving 4 stars because i like first two chapters."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Probably the best introductory book on AI.Breadth of topics covered.Will provide a good platform to pursue further on your chosen area in the field.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of the best book I have read to understand Machine Learning concepts. To kick start your journey as Machine Learning practitioner, start from this book to understand basics of Machine Learning algorithm and how they work."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"At 559, minus 50 rupees received as cashback, Amazon offered a decent deal. The language of the book is lucid. One of the best books available in the market for self study, if not the best. Topics have been covered with utmost care and to avoid confusions, the writer has provided quite a number of illustrations to differentiate between one topic and another. So on and so forth.Preferred over Rich and Knight"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want to be a great AI developer, this is a must have book. Great content and well with theory and codes. Codes are simplistics as well as pseudo code form."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The fundamental base of all AI courses. It covers the contents comprehensively from the very basics to advanced ones. Helps formulate various ideas and intuitions in your mind. But do check if the seller is a verified seller or else you would also end up getting a damaged book as me.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is very well written, and has practical examples using Python to test one ML model in action. Highly recommended."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book taught an overview of what is machine learning and how to create a model stage by stage. Also on how to use python for machine learning. Nice book helped me a lot.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,basic understanding of python language and very easy and clear to understand. definitely recommend for someone who wants to learn the basics of python
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The book is written in simple language easy to follow . Would recommend more details of Ann in the future edition .
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This little introduction to Machine Learning is a gem. It is for the absolute beginner as it explains in the title. But it acts as an extremely useful helicopter view of the subject, not in journalist style, but actually very true to the mathematics and methodologies underlying the techniques. The book also helps those thinking about a career in machine learning. They will get an overview of what it is about and what types of skills are required.For those with a deeper mathematical maturity, this book could also act as a good reference framework for all the different approaches and techniques covered. For example, to understand what reinforcement learning is (and why it is so difficult) or ensemble learning techniques. The real difference between standard regression and logistic regression. Traditional textbooks and monographs can become overburdened in the technical mathematics and make the reader lost in terms of where they are in the whole overall scheme of machine learning."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The knowledge of this book: Surface! It is, of course, for absolute beginners but I think, even if you are an absolute beginner, you can find other better sources online instead of reading this book. Who would understand the basics of neural networks after reading just 10 pages (from page 79 to page 89)?If you want to know/study/investigate machine learning, don't buy it. If you are only curious about what is machine learning and you only want to read a book on machine learning one time in life (yes, only one time in life), you can buy it but I believe it wastes your money!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I think this book does a really good job at explaining all the basic concepts of machine learning. I had started a Matlab course on ML at work for personal development  but to be honest I hadn't taken the time to get an overview of the basic concepts written in clear understandable language. This does the job quite nicely. Some comments say that you can get all the information  online... you could make thag comment about any knowledge base these days but thus is a well structured plain english book on machine learning that a pure beginner can sink their teeth into.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a good primer for any beginner who is curious about the field. Rather than just being an overview of the topic it gives some basic practical knowledge to make a start with machine learning. Losing a star due to being a very poor print. Mine had part of another book printed half way though not sure how that would even happen!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have wanted to introduce myself to the subject of machine learning for a while and therefore thought about buying a book that could provide a comprehensive overview of the basic concepts, which this book does very well. Superb for absolute beginners."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Marvellous and perhaps best book on ML in practice.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,The paper quality is terrible. You can notice next page's words mingling with current page. Such a bad reading experience.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First at all, don't be fooled by the ""visual non math approach"" which can sound like the book is superficial - which is absolutely not the case. The author goes down in deep details but all the time it is done very descriptive in an easily understandable language. The book works very well to be read from start to end as well as a compendium for looking up concepts and areas of interest. The book itself is in awesome printing quality with thick paper, solid binding and a lot of informative color illustrations (almost one pr page!).Highly recommended for both beginners and advanced users in deep learning and machine learning."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Deep Learning is changing our world. If you want to understand more, this is a great place to start. Andrew Glassner is a talented explainer - I took his short course on Deep Learning and learned so much, but also came away impressed at how well he can make complex material so clear and engaging. And this book is jammed packed with insights, visuals, and clear explanations. The author has a playful, sometimes quirky style that shines through, which gives this tour a lot of personality as well as information. Very enjoyable reading - I felt like he captured all that was good about his course (and then some) and bottled it up in this book. There is a lot more material here than in that course, and it is well laid-out and organized so that it is easy to roam around and come back to review the pieces that matter to you.Even if you plan to go to on to be a world-class Deep Learning engineer or mathematician, you have to start by understanding the concepts. And this book does a great job of presenting all the core ideas in a way that makes them clear and memorable."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice colorful printing unlike the other books published by No Starch. Very intuitive explanations. I have a feeling that this book will become a top-seller soon.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to understand, skips all the complex math that most books on the subject are full of. I highly recommend it."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like this book. It’s a great book for intro into deep learning.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a good reference book back to the classic ML methods, especially in today's ""import tensorflow as tf"" mentality, you tend to forget the ideas and math behind the more classic methods, such as EM and CRF. One should never forget the beauty of them."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great book. Having been exposed to the other two popular textbooks  in machine learning, ""The Elements of Statistical Learning"" and ""Pattern recognition and Machine Learning"", in university courses, I have to say that Murphy's ""Machine Learning"" is definitely the best one. It the most comprehensive one, it is better at explaining (because there is more detail) and it is also the most up-to-date one"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only con, is that this particular edition is a bit to heavy, so you have to read it on a table."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must read to anybody who is starting in Machine Learning. Some math prerequisites but worth every minute spent on it.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clearly written. Better than PRML of Bishop in my opinion. I should have bought it earlier.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great book. As of 7/12/2016 the edition shipped is the fourth reprint (the one you want). I gather that previous editions had lots of errors. Amazon has not updated the edition number in the product information.Easier to understand than PRML (Bishop) and yet more technical than David Barber's book. Motivations are better explained and algorithms given wider context than in ""the elements of statistical learning"" (Hastie)."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book covers latest machine learning theory and techniques. I use it everyday for reference book. I 'm a postdoc researcher.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great book
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a Data Scientist I have this book and use it regularly, it is an excellent reference book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The most thorough theoretical piece on machine and statistical learning and statistical model development I have ever met. Fine print, elegant paper, and lots of colour illustrations. Requiers some previous math/statistical background."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is a good place to start with. The author has put  lot of efforts to explain the topics in simple way.Over all the book is easily understandable.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best book one should read to get the all info about AR, would personally recommend to all AR enthu ppl and appreciate the author effort who has made it very easy to learn and helpful info to get to know about AR"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A must read book for all AR ethusiasts, developers, creators and researchers."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very well written. Easy to understand since it has been written by an Indian author. Every topic has been eloborated with suitable examples.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If any one is looking to get into AR and its applications both academically and professionally, this is a very good book to get started on the subject. The images, and the accompanied explanations will set the foundations for learning AR in a simple but effective way.Since its an emerging technology a book like this will definitely help set the right foundations to explore and go deep into AR.Definitely recommended.."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Covers most of the topics well. Bias variance trade off in knn could have been explained better. Didn't find topic on Support Vector Model. Applying GridSearchCV on different algorithms is not explained well.I would recommend this to start off with ML.Please note - This book does not target to guide on Pandas or Numpy.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must read book either for any novice or experienced ML enthusiast. All concepts are very briefly written and explaination is lucid. I would recommend this book along with practicing problems with datasets mentioned in the book to learn faster.Good luck for all ML enthusiasts and Future Data Scientists.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent material. It is true that many of the material is available on the internet etc, but the presentation and the explanations are very useful and orderly. An excellent textbook to get started or even reference as required. Highly recommended"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm impressed with the contents give. Very apt for teachers who wish to teach Basic ML concepts. Topics are briefly elucidated. A dedicated chapter could have been added regarding Ensemble techniques, however, the content included gives you a brief introduction of the same. Glad that Forecasting and Recommendation Systems are included."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book not only briefly covers mainstream ML topics but also gives you a quick revision of Python in the first lesson. In fact, even a total beginner can go along with this book. Amazing effort by Professor Pradhan and Kumar."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have just started reading it and read only 3 chapters of it, but can't resist myself from writing the review. I have been searching for the right book to start with the data science along with the online course and this book fits right in. The examples, way of writing the book are just excellent. Although this book is not comprehensive ( i believe no book on ML is) but it starts with the basic and clear concepts very well.Kudos to the authors."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good book but it skipped few important things like Support vector machines (leaving aside neural network which requires a book by itself)
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a brief and very good work by IIMB faculty on analytics with Python. The book starts from the basics of Anaconda IDE, Python syntax and scales up the reader to the nitty gritties of analytics and machine learning with Python. It's easy to read with plenty of illustrated examples."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,This book is not at all helpful. It dies not give proper in-depth knowledge of the ml algorithms. The explanations are very superficial. It is not for people who are looking for detailed explanation. Don't waste your money on this book. Watch YouTube videos for better understanding of the concepts.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't by this as ebook. It is a pdf doc that do not reflow on mobile devices.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent ouvrage pour les modèles prédictifs de Machine learning.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is a great review of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms. Not only the mathematical theory behind the algorithms, but also the data preparation the scoring metrics, and some examples of real-world use cases. A must read for a beginner in the space of data science."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having taken university courses in programming, machine learning as well as theoretical statistics I really enjoyed the emphasis in this book on both the statistical theory behind models, how to implement these models in code as well as what practical implications these models have in reality.A good book to take your knowledge further if you already know a little of statistics and programming and want to learn more about how machine learning can be applied on credit risk modelling."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Das Buch ist verständlich geschrieben
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"A book showing how to use APIs of python packages, even so, to me the quality of code is not good enough.It covers contents like data processing, modelling, validation and application of machine learning. However, Key concepts and processes of risk modelling were explained too shallow, cannot find many insights to learn.Disappointing. Maybe going deep should not be the only goal for doing credit risk..."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"All concepts of mathematics required for AI, machine learning and data science domain in one book explained clearly."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Un ""must"" pour débuter et comprendre les concepts qui façonnent l'apprentissage automatisé."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Massive book for who wants to know mathematical details of machine learning.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,After just few hours of reading some pages broke away. Shameful.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Un excelente contenido, buena pedagogía. Muy recomendable."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,A solid linear algebra and calculus knowledge is needed to understand this book.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is the missing piece between books like Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach and the mathematics you require to take such an undertaking. The authors do assume very little prior knowledge from the reader, but it t is recommended that you've had exposure to some of the mathematical topics prior to reading the book. But don't let that stop you if you're a beginner: you'll have to make a few detours to grasp some terms and such. Having said that, a course on single variable calculus ought to be under your belt. That's basically the only prerequisite.The explanations are clear, and the book is designed to bring clarity and lucidity onto the topics, not send the student on an endless pit of proofs and rigor."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I recommend the book for its clear delineations of sections within chapters. It makes for a good reference for calculations that may not be on the tip of your tongue.  I would lodge one major complaint, hence 4 stars, they should make the answers available for the questions at the end of the chapters. Without them, the quizzes are essentially a waste of space as you have no idea if your calculations are correct."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Best book if you are looking to study math of machine learning! Author has given references where to do further studies. If you are beginner to calculus , linear algebra and probability n statistics this is not the book since book expect you at advanced mathematics level Or studied the basics of math concepts in your curriculum"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Starts with the basics using clear examples and explanations. Then, moves quickly into intermediate level with practical and relevant information. Lastly, provides useful guidance towards advanced topics.Highly recommended.  Best book I have came across so far for starting my own ML journey."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book starts by explaining each function with an example that makes sense. But it builds on these pieces as the book continues.The approach is well disciplined and pretty quickly you are building solutions. A mix of theory and code with emphasis on the latter. You won’t learn calculus but you will learn how to do it from the code.Good for those who dropped out of Andrew Ng’s courses and mortals wanting results.Me: 40 years development, MBA, and 5 years data science.  Imagining and prediction mostly."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Chris Albon has a broad and deep knowledge of data science.  This book is a treasure of hints, explanations, and examples for the use of Python and associated libraries, including Pandas, in machine learning.  It is not a text, but it much more than cheat sheets.Chris begins with common operations with arrays, vectors, and matrices -- loading, sorting, examining, analyzing, combining, modifying, transforming.  Then continues with procedures used to prepare data -- data handling, normalization, standardization, encoding categories, selecting date ranges, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and cross-validation.  Several chapters review models, including techniques for model selection, hyper-parameter tuning, performance metrics, and discussions of fitting and validation.Each topic is clearly explained and accompanied by a short, self-contained, listing of a Python (Version 3) program as illustration.I highly recommend this book to all of us who need a quick refresher related to a command or procedure."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Book is quite useful, however contains alot of coding errors. I wouldn't recommend if completely new to coding in general, however if you are confident debugging (as the errors are generally small), it is useful. Not mentioned are some of the data files which are located on the authors github account (the url links in the book don't work also)"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great resource for quick and insightful tips for your machine learning challenges. As the author states, you do need to have python and machine learning experience to get maximum benefit from this book. I would argue that even those with less Machine Learning experience can learn a lot from the first 8 chapters. Chapters 9-21 are definitely best suited for someone that does have some experience using scikit-learn.Bottom line, this is a useful resource to have next to your computer when those machine learning problems pop up in your day to day work."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been studying data science during this pandemic; and since it has been a while since I graduated from college, my brain hasn't been as analytically sharp as I wanted it to be. And like many others, I've scoured the Internet to supplement what I have been studying. I've found many; but Chris's web site was the most organized and lucid to follow, with pertinent comments for practically every code. Hence each exercise is explained clearly. I realized I don't always have access to the Internet, so I decided to purchase the book. More power to Chris in helping us less mortals understand machine learning!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect when you need to find out how to do something specific, like most of the Cookbooks are. This one didn't disappoint."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,The layout on the kindle reader is an individual character rendering it impossible to read.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this book for a master's data science class and it is the one book I keep referring back to. If I forget how to code something or haven't done a particular task in a while,  i'll just pop it open, it's easy to find the right spot because each task has its own section and the code samples are great."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Tbh it’s very broad, but shallow."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book. Initial chapters on Data Mugging/Cleaning are very helpful. Def as advertised.
,2.0 out of 5 stars,A boring book. There is plenty of more engaging and through ML material out there.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As the name states, this book is very practical. It is focused on DOING more than LEARNING. And the best part is, it has a complete step by step chapter for ML projects.I would definitely recommend buying this book, if you are just starting out."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,Used book.Missing blank page.Images and printing very very poor.Dirty book.
,2.0 out of 5 stars,The book is good no doubt but amazon India packaging is and or nonexistent. It just wrapped in an amazon plastic bag which results in book pages getting bend in shipping. the book should be secured in a cardboard box
,4.0 out of 5 stars,One should have enough knowledge of ML concepts to grasp its in-depth and vast knowledge.May be they can create two volumes and cover more concepts in appendices.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice book, first of all the book quality was awesome and page quality is also very good. Secondly, the contents of the book was very nice it's interesting to read it also has practical code written not only theory. So in my opinion go for this book you will not regret."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well the product is nice but I received little bit of damage book of first 10 pages well it’s already damage from outside the packaging of cardboard not complaining as its a tiny thing but sometimes other people dont like it so....according to me i am satisfied with the book as its packed with knowledge
,4.0 out of 5 stars,The media could not be loaded.                                                                                   This book is written in a very simple english. Very easy to understand. They followed very simple and practical approach to make readers understand the  concept. The whole book is colourful and have many graphical object in it. You cannot take photocopy of this book as it is printed on glossy paper. It's a must have book for machine learning module.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,the content of the book is really good and easy to understand but I reduced one star due to the paper quality. no doubt the pages are nice but the paper used is very thin.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to start applying deep learning techniques and this book stands out on top. First few chapters will refresh your machine learning basics and every chapter is hands-on with maintained github repository. This will surely strengthen my deep learning knowledge.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is an excellent introduction to Machine Learning. The best part is that the author gives enough mathematical background of each topic and focuses mainly on the application. Also, the Github repo for this book is an excellent source for codes and algorithms."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hey you, yes you want learn machine learning, right? If yes, just order it right away. It will give you some practical experience with less theory."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If someone is looking for a beginner's knowledge in ML, then this is not the book for him/her. Having a good practical knowledge is a prerequisite to understand the deep theories explained here. This book is not for reading in hurry rather, a pen & paper should be kept to take notes while reading it slowly.  A slow & steady approach is needed to digest the topics fully especially the complex mathematical background.Initially, the language may sound little intimidating due to long sequence of words & sentences, but  one should not stop there. A lot of time & patience are needed."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,Is the diagrams in the Hardcover book colored or black and white?
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book. More bayesian oriented though.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice book for ML
,5.0 out of 5 stars,worth reading
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are a huge number of machine learning books now available. I own many of them. But I don't think any have had such an impact as Chris Bishop's effort here - I certainly count it as my favourite. The material covered is not exhaustive (although good for 2006), but it's a good springboard to many other advanced texts. (The moniker of ML 'Bible' has apparently been passed to Kevin Murphy's book.) What *is* covered is explained with exceptional clarity with an eye for understanding the intuition as well as the theory.If you are after a practitioners guide, or a first ML book for self study, this probably isn't ideal. It assumes significant familiarity with multivariate calculus, probability and basic stats (identities, moments, regression, MLE etc.). The pitch is probably early post-graduate level, but with a few stretching parts. If this is your background, I think it's a better first ML book than MacKay (Information Theory ...), Murphy (Machine Learning ...), or Hastie et al. (Elements of Statistical Learning), due to its coherence of topics and consistency of depth. But those books are all excellent in their own ways. However, Barber (Bayesian Reasoning ...) is a good alternative.Most chapters are fairly self contained, so once you've worked your way through the first couple of chapters, you can skip around as required. A particular highlight for me were the chapters on EM and variational methods (ch 9 & 10); I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better explanation of either of them. Finally, worth pointing out it's unrepentantly Bayesian, and lacking some subtelty which may be grating for seasoned statisticians. Nevertheless, if the above sounds like what you're looking for, this is probably a good choice."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a must get for Machine Learning students. It covers every fundamental concept of ML. However, it is not quite beginner level friendly, meaning you are required to have some understanding of basic probability and linear algebra. I am giving four stars due to the way it's printed. The print paper quality is good and I can confirm it is hardcover but the margin is bit unusual with wide space on the left hand side."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great book with one of the most clear presentations of several fundamental algorithms. In my experience this is a book I keep coming back to.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I take back my previous negative review (DHL returned without delivering to me for some reason not explained).  I received the book today and very happy - exactly as expected - excellent quality!
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good in-depth book on pattern recognition. The only problem I have with it is that it can be a challenge to read. I find it easier to understand new mathematical techniques and equations when they come coupled with a good intuitive explanation for people who find it harder to just look at an equation and instantly ""get it"". I find that this book isn't as good at this as I would like, but it is so full of useful information that it's still a great book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a Data Scientist and wanted to learn MLOps for a long time but couldn't find a good resource. The information in MLOps is all scattered and confusing/conflicting on the internet. I generally found fluffy or theoretical books/resources. Now, finally found this book! It laid down a good foundation and case for MLOps and has hands-on implementation. I could work on the practical implementation of building, deploying and monitoring an ML model using a CI-CD pipeline and I am gradually feeling confident about MLOps now to implement it in my work. The book gave me new insights on ML testing, security, pipeline orchestration and monitoring.Recommend this book!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With practical examples and hands-on implementation of use-cases, I enjoy learning by doing with this book. The language is simple to understand and the concepts are easy to grasp, this book is one of the best in the market for learning practical MLOps implementation.One real-life business problem was solved throughout the book, which made it easier to grasp the concepts and different stages of MLOps. I think this one is beneficial for experienced engineers as well as business people in tech companies.Verdict: Recommended!"
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"As a person with  degrees in Physics, Economics & Maths, and other formal academic qualifications in Probability & Stats, I thought that I would get a lot out of this book. However I didn't! I've just finished reading it and I wish I hadn't bothered. The explanations are extremely superficial and don't really explain anything - lots of words but no depth. The examples don't make sense. I do wonder if the authors are simply parroting things that they've been told about but don't really understand.  My advice is to look elsewhere for teaching on AI&ML I'm disappointed because other ""... For Dummies"" books (like the one on Economics) were really good."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good starter text
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a good book at all. Really boring to read, no real flow, and the concepts are explained backwards. Many of the terms are used before defined, and hard to see the big picture. I ended up learning the subject much better from other sources (deep learning with python by Francois Chollet, deeplearning.ai specialization, for example). I also own the book Python for Data Science, and it is equally bad. I realized it is because it is the same author. I love For Dummies books, but the author matters. Avoid this author."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As the book's title says, It is for Dummies who have absolutely no knowledge about this topic.Though this book is good, you'll find yourself flipping through multiple chapters to skip as those would be too easy to go through. Initial eight chapters covers just the installation of Python and R and just some fundamental setup. Even though I am completely new to Machine Learning, it ain't for me.If you are new to this field but very enthusiastic than there is a very high possibility that you have some basic knowledge. I would rather recommend this book to kids in school(11-14), this would be perfect for them."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"You know how they say somebody really understands a topic when they can explain it to laymen in simple terms? Well, on that basis, the authors still have some way to go before being able to claim they have mastered the topic. Yes, the style is conversational and chatty, a bit like two university lecturers delivering a course on Machine Learning, but it isnot hard to imagine the looks of befuddlement and confusion on the faces of the students attending the course. There must be better books than this one to get to grips with the basics of ML."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a starter book , considering I had zero knowledge of ML.This is absolutely perfect. The 15 chapters are each roughly 8 to 10 pages and can easily be read with a coffee in about 20 to 25 minutes.After 3 days, I am 5 chapters in and already have some of the large concepts and have a very brief idea of some ot the current buzzwords in MLI'd fully recommend this book for people like me who are new to ML.Darren"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to know where to start in learning computer programming, and I think this book is a  good beginning for anybody with very little knowledge."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book was clear and interesting. We were covering the basics of ML in anomaly-based intrusion detection and prevention and I needed a little more than was provided in the lectures. Great intro to the world of ML and pointer to next steps in a very interesting journey.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book should be read by students who wish to begin a career in machine learning as it is good at explaining concepts by adding examples, along with the actual code."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have just finished reading this excellent introduction to the topic of Machine Learning. It has been a long time since I have read any book in a single four hour sitting, with my brain so alight with the possibilities implied by what I’m reading about."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very interesting intro to machine aided AI and has the best instructions for a beginner.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am quite new to machine learning and expecting this book to start with the basic understanding of ML. However, it turns out to be a bit complex for me. The book is good however, you should have the basic understanding of ML concepts first. It directly starts with standard libraries like sci-kit, numpy and matplotlib etc...I had referred other sites for clearing basic understanding and reading this book. Good one though"
,3.0 out of 5 stars,The book is meant to be introductory but dives straight into Python programming with NumPy and sklearn without showing the ropes of the libraries.  The introduction to the ML concepts is gentle and well explained but the code is shoved down your throat and you better run to the docs to see what is actually does.Saving point is: if you are teaching ML (like me) and need good well designed examples go for this book; also if you need very visual explanations.  Would not recommend the book for a student though.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent guide to starting machine learning. The difficulty level is geared towards those with a little knowledge of computer science & programming, but might be too gentle for more experienced coders. I'm only part-way in, so will try to remember to update once I've completed the book."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,The explanation on machine learning is very basic and the codes inside doesn't worth buying it.  It s waste of your money.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great and Comprehensive Handbook for Machine Learning
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This may be the most poorly written textbook I’ve ever seen. It’s basically a curriculum of material to study. I couldn’t name a single chapter that I think is particularly well-written. There is a section “Learning to rank”, which is in the GLM chapter, the author even admits that it has nothing to do with GLMs but didn’t have space elsewhere, it speaks volumes...Do yourself a favor and learn the material from other sources (Bishop’s classic; Rasmussen/Williams for GPs; Efron/Hastie “Computer Age Statistical Inference”; Robert/Marin “Bayesian Essentials with R” are very good references).The newer edition, which is expected in early 2022, doesn’t look much better. I have seen the discussion of the drafts on GitHub, and I also reported a bunch of typos as well as serious errors myself. I was astonished by both the incompetence and indifference of Dr Murphy with regard to technicalities and details. The fact that almost all graphics are ‘stolen’ from other sources is also quite telling: The author doesn’t have passion for teaching and he shouldn’t be doing it."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The field now collected beneath the standard of 'Machine Learning' is so vast, and draws from so many different schools of thought, and hence mindsets, notations and assumptions, that it is extremely hard to take your bearings.  Even knowing what exists, and how it relates to the rest of what exists, is extremely difficult. The old school statistics guys speak one language, the machine learners another, and the Bayesian chaps yet a third, and so although there are many unifying ideas, these are hard to identify.  The primary strength of this book is that it allows the reader to see the connections by providing a unifying framework and notation all the way from basic distributions through standard statistical models to machine learning black-boxes and out to applied algorithms.  Many sections end in current academic references, as well as current practical uses thereof.  I have wanted such a text for a very long time, and am thrilled to have found it.Beyond that, the approach that the book takes to maths hits the sweet-spot between the thicket of lemma-lemma-theorem-proof found in 'academic' books, and the hand-wavy elisions found in 'practitioners' book.  That is, important proofs are stated and fully worked, within the context of softer discussion of the concepts presented.  Finally, having the source code for all images in the books allows you to dive in and really understand by doing.  Having this code a gold standard off which to base your own software is fantastic.I have read the other main books in this area (PGM, ESL, PRML etc) and think this is the most broad, thorough and unified presentation available.  It can be used as the foundation for understanding this field."

The first 3 chapters are really good but can’t find the first book anywhere. Kinda frustrating. If you don’t read the first books this book won’t make much sense after Chapter 2."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just an unbelievable book. It may be a bit difficult to follow but complemented by a couple of online resources for when you're stuck it's awesome. Definitions are precise. Explanations are succinct.It is not intended to be, but is a masterpiece that brings out the beauty of mathematics."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Even though I can get a free e-copy, I still like the paperback version because I flip through it occasionally. This book sketches a clear big picture of the knowledge tree for ML and provides necessary build blocks to help you build solid foundations in preparation for practical ML.You have to be aware this paperback version doesn't come with solutions. One of my reason to buy this is for the solutions. It turned out that only instructors can request solutions from the press company."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fits my needs pretty well.  A well-curated collection of the essential math for AI and ML.  I purchased the physical copy, despite having the free PDF, because I enjoyed it a lot and plan to re-read it with more detailed note-taking and highlighting on the book itself.  I did have to consult other sources just to clear up some parts but was expected in reading a math book.  Highly recommended!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In college, I was bored out of my mind during Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Statistics courses. I wish the concepts would be introduced in the way they are in this book. For example, partial differentiation and gradients are explained in terms of neural network weight optimization / gradient descent. This book is especially valuable if you know the basic intuition behind machine learning and neural networks, and also have a basic intuition behind the math, and want to combine this intuition with a formal mathematical understanding."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The format - definition, theorem, example - make this book very accessible to all STEM undergraduates. It is a good survey of introductory topics found in a linear algebra and multivariable calculus course. However, if you have already taken these courses or taken much more difficult math, this book is a disappointment -  it references a lot of other texts when the math gets interesting - i.e. instead of covering the approximation of linear equations via Krylov methods, it just reference other texts if you are interested."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is excellent for brushing up your mathematics knowledge required for ML. It is very concise while still providing enough details to help readers determine important parts. This is my go-to if I need to review some concepts or brush up on my knowledge in general.I wouldn't recommend this book if you have absolutely no prior math experience though as it can be hard to digest and sometimes they would skip parts here and there in proofs and examples. Especially for the probability section, the concepts will be very hard to grasp without prior knowledge"

Results stated in the text often do not correspond to the code snippets they refer to. The code snippets are full of bugs, some just blatantly careless as to suggest they were never tried, and it leads me to think there was minimal editing done. Moreover, the code examples are stated in buggy Python 2. (Who uses Python 2 in 2020 when many cloud platforms are going so far as to discontinue support for it altogether?)"
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"As one reviewer commented, the first chapter is good, full of interesting insights about applications of ML to asset management. The next eight go off into the weeds of obscure jargon, badly formatted code, graphics and math equations. I am reviewing the Kindle version, it is ironic that another reviewer should complement the print edition formatting. If you live and breathe correlation matrices and hack p-values in your sleep and happen to be an advanced user/developer of ML, then this little text is your cup of tea! For the general reader I would only recommend if they had pretty good mastery of machine learning already.Benjamin Graham's Intelligent Investor by contrast is aimed toward the informed layman and is still one of the top books I would recommend for investment philosophy. I have read about 30 books on investing in the past year and a half with investing philosophies from value oriented to technical analysis to growth oriented and I have gotten valuable, actionable information from all of them to some degree.  This text, not so much! I am a software developer by profession and I have a decent understanding of calculus and basic statistics so I am not put off by books that have a fair amount of quantitative/technical content that I have to stretch to understand like Python for Finance by Hilpisch and A Non-Random Walk down Wall Street by Lo and MacKinlay.  I should have returned it under the 7 day return window for Kindle purchases. The good part is that is was not expensive. I will return to this book when I have taken some ML courses and gotten some practice with toolkits like SciKit-Learn to get ideas on how ML can complement traditional mathematical economic techniques."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Das Buch von Bishop ist ein Lehrbuch wie man es nicht so oft antrifft. Das Ziel, Musterkernnungsalgorithmen ist nur ein Aufhänger um in geschlossener Form alle Grundlagen von Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung, Statistik, Regressions und Klassifikationsrechnung und algorithmen Maschinellen Lernens vorzustellen. Dabei bleiben die notwendigen Vorkenntnisse auf basiskenntnisse in Linearer Algebra (Vektor- und Matrizenrechnung) und an wenigen Stellen Differentialrechnung beschränkt.Jede Thematik wird umfassend motiviert, sodass nicht wie in anderen Büchern oft das Ziel einer Rechnung vor lauter geschwurbel untergeht.Bishop ist der Bayesianischen Statistik verpflichtet. Für den Leser ist das ein großer Gewinn, der Bayesianische Ansatz ist in der Darstellung Bishops überaus verständlich  und erleichtert meiner Meinung nach Insbesondere das Verständnis der Ansätze sehr. Als Konsequenz des Bayesianischen Ansatzes sind manche Rechnungen/Herleitungen durchaus etwas länger als in frequentistischer Literatur und auch oft anspruchsvoller. Am Ende bleibt aber das Gefühl die Zusammenhänge besser verstanden zu haben.An dieser Stelle möchte ich auch Hervorheben, dass das Buch viele sehr anschauliche Grafiken und Schaubilder hat.

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This book packs a lot of useful knowledge in one place which is convenient for students of machine learning. However Bishop spends an equal amount of time elucidating on side matters which makes it difficult to tell what is important. Bishop also has a nasty habit of doing derivations but skipping past the most complex steps, as if he were too lazy to type them out. While I found the topics interesting, it benefited me much more to use Google to find explanations that were both shorter and less confusing."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have seen one of Lopez de Prado's lectures, you will understand immediately that his work offers advances to standard problems in portfolio management. This small book summarizes the main contributions and cannot be recommended strongly enough.The book is comprised of several very dense chapters of all new material in the field. These include advances in covariance estimation based on random matrix theory, optimal clustering, labelling methods for trend tracking, using ML for variable selection for prediction, hierarchical risk parity (instead of Markowitz portfolio optimization) for portfolio selection, and two alternatives to standard sharpe-ratio back testing of strategies. All of these new methodologies address fundamental problems with the standard techniques that have been used for decades in portfolio theory and in sum represent a big step forward in the theory.This book is worth purchasing just to read the introduction. It gives great insight into how to use machine learning for finance that you won't find in any other book.The author devised a machine learning algorithm based on 'theories' of finance 'discovered' from machine learning, not based on back testing. This made all the difference during the flash crash. Unlike many others, his algorithm made lots of money during this period because of the way he designed it.This book will NOT teach you general machine learning techniques. As the author admits in the introduction, you must learn these things from other books. But the techniques here should be acquired by everyone in finance."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"""Machine Learning for Asset Managers"" is everything I had hoped.In this concise Element, De Prado succinctly distinguishes the practical uses of ML within Portfolio Management from the hype.Concepts are presented with clarity & relevant code is provided for the audiences’ purposes.This work serves as support for the argument that there are better systematic & objective methods for creating investment portfolios than the simplified heuristics of our past.For that, I am thankful.De Prado’s work will be remembered as the 21st Century’s “The Intelligent Investor” (Benjamin Graham)."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In his ""Advances in Financial Machine Learning"" Marcos Lopez de Prado touches on multiple uses for asset managers, my personal favorite one was his asset allocation process where he compensates for what he calls the ""Markowitz's curse"".This new book though, it just expands on the best concepts of the other one, particularly for anyone interested in asset management. Just wow... An absolute fountain of useful and actionable information for any asset manager.It also happen to me one of the most beautifully printed books I've ever had."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not very insightful and looks like a data scientist is presenting his/her day job. Good for people completely new to data science. Would be helpful if it could highlight what’s the difference or so special about asset management applications vs others
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am commenting about the hardcover second edition of this book.After lending the first edition from a friend for some time, I enjoyed it so much that though that it was time to get my own copy. I like the algorithmic approach to the methods explained and I think that using Python, a language that was designed to be readable, is a good idea. It covers many of the relevant methods that are actually used in machine learning and it was very useful for me to get an intuition of what is behind an algorithm.However, I am not happy with the quality of the printing. There are a lot of compression artefacts in the images and small black dots all around (you can see them in the pictures). The letters look blurry and are difficult to read. The problem is even worse in the sections with code that have a grey background. It is like the black ink is neither black nor grey, the kind of printing that you get from a inkjet printer in ""draft"" quality. I do not know if this is a problem with my book or with all the edition but it makes the book very difficult to read sometimes. I do not remember those problems in the first edition. This is not what I expect for this price."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good approach, and with Python now becoming so prevalent in research, then to be able to download .py scripts for the examples explained is a massive bonus. Machine Learning / Big Data may appear buzzwords, but there is no avoiding the fact that it has real meaning and affecting our lives from even relatively simple interactions with search engines through to issues such as interpretation of climate data and extensive climate simulations."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've read many technical books in my time, including quite a few on machine learning (ML), and this is easily the worst I've ever read. There is no way anyone is going to learn ML from this book. There is a lot of irrelevant waffle, like how reading this book isn't going to enable you to recreate the next C3PO (duh, really?), and a whole load of other stuff that's just a waste of space. Even the parts that describe ML do it in such a poor way that you're very unlikely to work out what they are on about. It's all theory, with no practical background, each bit of theory being ""explained"" (and I use that word with some caution) in isolation, with no reference to how they fit together, how or when you might use them, or indeed anything that might give them some use.However, the worst part is that there is absolutely nothing in the way of practical examples. In most technical subjects, and especially a complex one like ML, the best (possibly only) way to learn is to walk through an example. Every other book I've read on this subject has started with a dataset, described it, done a quick visual examination (which is a good way to introduce some of the basic features of the language(s) and package(s) being used), then described an outline of a ML technique, and then built up a complete example of using that technique to analyse the data, explaining every step as you go along. This book doesn't even contain any significant code samples! The most you get are a few isolated (as in, not connected to any description of a technique, nor connected to any other code) snippets, with zero to little explanation of what the code is doing , or when/where/why you might use it.Given that the book wastes two chapters showing you how to install R and Python in painful detail (like screenshots of the licence screen on the install wizard), and then another two on hopelessly badly explained introductions to the two languages, they don't even use those languages in anything more than small snippets. With nothing other than this book, you would not have the first clue where to start writing even the most basic piece of code, and certainly nothing that even approaches ML.The only notable thing about this book at all is that it's the first time ever that I'm going to return a book to Amazon, based on the poor content. I've got a few books that weren't so great, but I've always kept them, as they've never been quite THAT bad. This one manages to be even worse, and is going back.If it were possible to give this book a zero or negative rating, I would. It really is that bad."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reading through rad Kuhns brilliant Applied Predictive Modelling, and various other detailed Machine learning texts. (Gave up on numerous books when the maths got too heavy. ) I bought this as a lighter summer refresher read, and to get into applying R Machine learning.This book is really quite impressive in providing a lot of useful insight and explanation into core machine learning principles and application. So after a rather slow start on justifications of machine learning and the necessary setting up of both Python and R Machine learning, the book eventually gets into the real subject matter at Chapt 9, and goes through basic probabilistic, naïve bayes, before concentrating on Gradient descents , Overfitting, PCA and SVD reduction, k Means clustering and K nearest neighbour classification algorithms are easily explained. Then in to the linear methods, Neural nets, SVMs and Random Forests are well explained. The EigenFaces explanation and execution for Face recognition was new to me, even though I have read a  number of detailed deeper books on Machine learning. Extensive links are provided throughout and within context the text to offer expansions on detail, without detracting from the flow.If you want an easier introduction to Machine Learning, without being exposed to excessive maths to cloud your insights, this is an excellent way to get into the subject and start applying the technology in Python and R from the get go. Don't be a ML snob, get this book if you want to get into ML."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bei einem Buch über Programmiersprachen stellt sich zwangsläufig immer die Frage: für welches Publikum ist so ein Werk geeignet? In diesem Fall sind das User, die bereits gewisse Grundkenntnisse in Python mitbringen. Auch sollte man nicht ganz unbedarft im Thema Datenauswertung und -visualisierung sein.Tiefgreifende mathematische Erläuterungen zu den einzelnen Methoden würde man in dem Buch vergeblich suchen und das finde ich gut so. Die Autoren beschränken sich auf das Elementare, nämlich welche Vor- und Nachteile die jeweiligen Machine Learning Algorithmen mit sich bringen, für welche Datentypen sie am besten geeignet sind, welche Voraussetzungen der User schaffen kann oder muss um sein eigenes Projekt in diesem Kontext zu bestreiten.Wer immer wieder mal ein paar Dinge über Machine Learning aufgeschnappt hat, oder sogar schon einmal unbedarft etwas in die Richtung programmiert hat, wird eine wahre Serie von ""Aha!""-Erlebnissen haben. Anschauliche Beispiele aus der Praxis erhöhen die Nachvollziehbarkeit der Methoden und können einen mitunter an dieses Buch fesseln, wie ein guter Roman.Von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung für Studenten, Doktoranden, Hobbyprogrammierer und Nicht-Mathematiker, die nach einem Startschuss / Kickoff für ihr persönliches Projekt suchen und bislang von der Fülle an Möglichkeiten in scikit-learn überfordert waren."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Man sollte den Titel wörtlich nehmen, es ist primär eine ""Introduction"" zum Thema klassisches Machine Learning mit Python. Die Kapitel geben einen guten Überblick über die wichtigsten Methoden bezüglich Preprocessing, (un-)supervised Learning sowie Verification. Man sollte jedoch beachten, dass nicht eingehend auf die dargelegten Funktionen eingagengen wird - eine grobe Beschreibung der Standardfunktionalität sowie eine kurze Anwendung ist alles, was man bekommt. Möchte man die Parameter manueller anpassen, muss man zwangsläufig in die Dokumentation gucken.Das ist insbesondere der Punkt, der mir übel aufstößt bei dem Buch: Die Beispiele sind teilweise 1:1 aus der SciKit Learn Dokumentation übernommen. Ich bin ja einerseits dankbar, dass man mir einen Überblick über interessante Merkmale gibt, andererseits erwarte ich tiefergehende Recherche als nur Absätze aus einer frei verfügbaren Dokumentation zu ziehen.Darüberhinaus sind einige Beispiele wenig eingängig, wie z.B. der kapitellange Abschnitt zur Bilderklassifikation. Da wird schlicht und einfach ein Algorithmus nach dem anderen angewandt und jedes Mal das Resümee gezogen ""hiermit hat es besser geklappt"". Es fühlt sich schlussendlich nach einem Lückenfüller an, ohne dass es mir essentiellen Mehrwert gegeben hat.Zu den wirklich guten Punkten des Buchs gehört das Kapitel über Supervised Learning. Hier macht das kurze Anreißen durchaus Sinn, wo schnell dargelegt wird, wie der jeweilige Algorithmus ""denkt"" sowie zwei/drei Parameter, auf die man achten soll. Die Zusammenfassungen am Ende der Kapitel gibt die Informationen nochmals schön gebündelt wieder.Sowieso kann man das Buch sehr gut herunterlesen und hat danach das Gefühl, bereit zu sein, es anzuwenden. Bei mir hat die Umsetzung gut geklappt - jedoch habe ich kaum mehr in das Buch geguckt, weil viel tieferes Verständnis in der Praxis nötig ist.Somit empfehle ich das Buch jedem, der seine erste Gehversuche wagen möchte und eine angenehme, wenngleich nicht tiefergehende Einführung zum Thema Machine Learning mit SciKit-Learn braucht. Es ist einen in den ersten Stunden ein treuer Begleiter, der aber bald durch ausführlichere Literatur ersetzt werden muss."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book does a nice job of explaining data mining concepts and predictive analytics. The main tool software tool they use is RapidMiner. Curiously RapidMiner was only introduced in chapter 13, the last chapter, although the authors mention you may want to read this chapter first.Some aspects of this book are done really nicely, like when they explain the Iris data set, which is a famous data set of flowers. There is a diagram (pg. 39) in the book showing the flower, and which labels showing which part of the flower is sepal length and which is petal length. I was familiar with the Iris data set before this book, but the diagram taught me what the sepal length meant exactly.There are lots of diagrams throughout the book which show different ways to visualize data and most concepts have clear explanations. The balance was reasonable between explaining techniques and showing how they are used.I would have liked to see more application of some of the concepts and RapidMiner specifically. Overall, this book does a good job of explaining the concepts and techniques of data mining."

What is missing are some insights on how to interpret the results obtained from each model and what you can do with it."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not impressed. The book seems hastily written and contains little substance, much like this review."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Explains the mains concepts simply. Really a perfect introduction to the topic
,3.0 out of 5 stars,The book is ok for review of basic AIML. I found the book bit more technical for beginners as opposed to focusing on the basics.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Short but nice overall.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for beginners. It shows the ropes as intended
,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good to get some context.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,As promised... Thank you!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this book so much I bought two copies, in case one copy is not in convenient reach.  It is beautifully written, and very informative.  I like that it is written for a person just becoming acquainted with machine learning, as well as for a person who has seasoned knowledge.  Regardless of who is reading it, one can deepen and expand one's knowledge.  It is also packed with sterling examples that one can use to explain complicated statistical techniques to those with limited subject matter exposure.  I think this book is one that will help others love machine learning and grasp how it will shape our future."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good overview of data science’s methods. Good for beginners or persons who work with data. Took a few hours to read and I can always come back to this book.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not exactly the best book for beginner to dive into. Extra research must be done to clear understand the concepts in this field. Not enough practical examples.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's not bad.  Includes  none of strained jokes that spoil many books in this series
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Provides a scope and state of knowledge overview and gives ready access to code and data to play with many examples. Useful for an outsider to AI who is looking for routes in to various problems. More tuned to the business than to the scientific world in the examples given.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As a non technical user, I was looking for a book that would give me a solid overview of machine learning so that I could understand it's applications and limitations and whether or not we should consider applying these at work. This Dummies guide is that for about 3 chapters and then quickly becomes a starters guide to running your first machine learning projects using R and Python. For me this was too much detail, but if you have a coding background and want to take your first steps in this new application of algorthims it seemed like a good place to start. Just too in-depth for me!"
,3.0 out of 5 stars,There is a lot of reading about Machine Learning and concepts. Nothing practical. Just concepts explained in simple language. That get's the dummy part delivered.
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I studied computer science in the 1990s, so while I do not know anything about Machine Learning (it did not feature in university classes then!), I would not classify myself as a real dummy either. Still this book baffles me. It has a a LOT of content. Unfortunately it is not organized and explained well. It has three issues:1) Poor ordering of chapters. It requires you to first read chapters on the basics of R and Python programming languages and how to install them on your computer. But then the next chapters go back to theory and do not use the languages at all. The chapters are all over the place and I found myself skipping back and forth often.2) Arbitrary and poor explanations. Basic statistical concepts such as the ""median"" are for some strange reason explained in a lot of detail, while new machine learning terminology is frequently used before it is explained (in later chapters), causing confusion and making the text extremely hard to read.3) Too much text and not enough visuals and charts to explain. A picture can say more than a 1000 words, yet the book keeps using a vast number of words and you end up not quite getting it.I can tell the authors know a lot about the topic, and there is a lot of stuff in here. But they are not able to teach this to dummies in a clear way. I thought that was what this book series was about."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to work for cybersecurity company which prided itself in using machine learning algorithms in its product. Everyone who joined had to read this book to be able to talk to analysts and internal tech. The book does a good job giving a general understanding on the different types of machine learning and how to use different programming languages to facilitate machine learning.Not an easy text to chew through but as far as technical literature goes, this is light reading.I have found some other dummy intro books more helpful though, hence the reduced star."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This isn't bad as an in introduction.  It is quite hard to review though.  For people who are interested in the technical side this might seem a bit basic and for those who just want to know a little bit more about the topic  for work, study or just out of general interest it is too technical.It obviously follows the usual For Dummies format but fortunately it isn't as slow moving or laborious as they often are.Ultimately though you might get quite a lot out of this there are plenty of free courses and resources that are more useful."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are looking for an introduction to machine learning without getting overwhelmed with mathematics, then this book is a good option. I found that the author generally does a good job in explaining concepts in a simple way.  The book also avoids the jokey style, that in other Dummies books I find can lead to clutter and soon get irritating.This is not a book that will give you depth, but it does a good job of introducing machine learning concepts and toolsets."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Target audience: Graduate students and researchers relatively new to the field of Bayesian learning.(+)Clearly written.High-quality print (figure quality is much higher than that of your average textbook).Fresh approach to HMMs and the Kalman Filter. Yes, the Kalman filter / smoother equations make much more sense when derived from a graphical model.A quick Google search will yield some accompanying lecture videos from the author (on graphical models and sequential learning).Solutions for the ""www""-marked exercises are available from the author's webpage.(neutral)Formula-heavy so not for the faint of heart.(-)Little emphasis on computational / implementation aspects. There is no ""official"" (author's) code for the algorithms discussed in the book - however, there are some good-quality 3rd party implementations available on the web.Most of the exercises simply fill-in the missing steps in the algebra derivations. There are no coding exercises.Some of the data sets used in the book don't seem to be available anymore (at least not at the URL given in the book).Highly recommended. Best when used in conjunction with the 3rd party (MATLAB /Python) codes available on the web."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great introduction to machine learning. I work in an analytical team and got this book as an addition to our team bookcase.The book serves as a good first step in understanding what machine learning is and include both R and Python code; this is particularly useful as both codes are open source and free to use.Some have said that the book is too basic but I think there is plenty to get your teeth into here. Once this book has been mastered you might want to buy something not for dummies.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good book for studying machine learning
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Testo pluripremiato e ultra utilizzato in ambiti accademici e non. Credo che sia oramai uno dei principali testi di riferimento sull'argomento ( Pattern Matching e Machine Leraning ), insieme al classico di Tom Mitchell.A differenza di quest'ultimo, tuttavia, il testo di Bishop è pregno di esempi e applicazioni derivanti da Computer Vision e Image processing."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Der Inhalt des Buchs ist gut, mein Hauptkritikpunkt sind allerdings sämtliche Grafiken, da diese in Grautönen abgedruckt wurden. Das macht das Interpretieren schwierig, da die Grafiken dadurch äußerst unübersichtlich sind. Der Autor bezieht sich im Text auch teilweise auf die Farben von Datenpunkten, also soll das wohl nicht der Sinn sein.Ich weiß nicht was mir hier zugesandt wurde, da sowohl in der Vorschau des Buchs auf O'Reilly als auch in PDF-Versionen, die im Internet verfügbar sind, alle Grafiken in Farbe gedruckt wurden.Zum Vergleich habe ich zwei Fotos angehängt."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,It really Mother of All Books - very in-depth knowledge has been presented.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not a full convert to the 'Big Data' religion, but Kotu and Deshpande show how to extract insight and meaning from large data sets, in ways that make sense to me. The book is full of worked examples, is perfect for an novice and math challenged person such as myself. I'm sure experienced data analysts will also appreciate the deep knowledge and experience the authors bring to the subject, and will ;find new, different and better ways to tackle some thorny problems.Also notable are Vijay Kotu's credentials: he does this for a living at Yahoo!, is clearly a master practitioner in this new field.Highly recommended for anyone grappling with ecommerce, wanting to understand why and how to maximize conversions from browsing to buying.5 stars."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It is not for beginners. Read this only if you have sufficient knowledge in ML. Beauty of this book lies in the explaining mathematical nature of the data & algorithms. Gives a complete different view about ML. It has very good recipes to make your knowledge more deeper and it also covers wide variety of topics like Hebbian Learning, Graphical Models, Bayesian Networks etc. Should be an excellent read for experts."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Although the book is pretty short (~120p) it covers all the key areas of graph representation learning in an informative and engaging manner. The algorithmic derivations are always clear and well described, and the book quickly covers off the headlines and gotchas. Highly recommended primer, my only wish is that it had been accompanied by coded examples."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Book would be ok, but the book is on the open source 'RapidMiner' which is worthless."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my latest go to book for data mining and Rapidminer.This book gives detailed step by step instructions on using the tool.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent book to learn to apply Data mining with RapidMiner
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is really a good start for learning both data mining and RapidMiner. With the step by step guided through the hands on in each chapters make this book much clearer picture of data mining to me. Highly recommended!
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's another basic book that explains Rapidminer.Given that the company didn't feel it necessary when they started to provide and adequate documentation on the product, this is good. I only rated it 3-stars because I personally thought that the book, Data Mining for the Masses, did a better job explaining what to do overall."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was wonderfully surprised to see a lot of data mining concepts taught right a long side how to implement them in RapidMiner, complete with pictures and equations ( overviews ).If you  know a little data mining, and looking for a book to help you use RapidMiner to put your knowledge into practice, this it!"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very pleased with this book.  I researched it before buying it.  The author extensively researched machine learning algorithms and put them in a single book.  That's what I was looking for.  AI is a never ending discipline so everyone is a student in AI.  As a student in AI, I quickly noticed the big number of foundational algorithms and I was looking for a book like this one that will serve as a reference."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this book 2 days ago based on the reviews posted. Not sure I'm reading the same book because a few pages into the book, page 9, there are ""ridiculous"" errors. Given the set A = {1,2,3,5,7,9}, how can mean (A) = 4.67? Or median(A) = 4.5? The errors just continue as example is developed.We can argue that the book is for advanced readers but with errors this basic, I worry that I would spend valuable time proofreading.Kudos to the author for putting together a book this big. Aside the errors, the font/print quality is disappointing e.g. Table of Contents page is visually unappealing!Maybe my views will change if I complete reading the book but I have lost interest already. I most likely will return and try a different book/publisher."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,really good book :)
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I look at algorithms like appliances in a department store. Each has a particular use-case and purpose. For instance, depending on your individual needs while shopping for appliances most often stop to glance at the specs then at the cost to see if a particular unit suits their needs.Few ever think to build the appliance from scratch but rather by one already made to serve their needs progressively adopting it as an augmentation to everyday life. Even easier is when these items can be cataloged in one place, shopped, and put into use immediately (think Sears catalog of 1888). In its first catalog, Sears sold jewelry and watches. The directories grew in popularity, and with time different products were added and tested, even whole houses!While algorithms are not a new thing, thanks to the father of algebra: Abdullah Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi, it should NOT be challenging to catalog them. This book one of the best, like it, does that facilitating faster solutioning to get to the point of solving problems using built appliances (machine intelligence: algorithms)."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this book (1st and 2nd edition)  in my Machine Learning class for a couple of years. Together with the Raschka and Mirjalili book (Python Machine Learning), Bonnacorso's provides a solid foundation for understanding the key algorithms, how they work, and how to fine-tune them. Both amanuals re required in my class and my students have only had positive feedback about both books. They are complementary as Bonnacorso does not cover some topics such as Natural Language Processing compared with Raschka, for instance."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a mathematical book, so its full of equations. On my kindle every symbol (Greek letter etc) is replaced by the empty (tofu) symbol. On kindle cloud reader it's. not all symbols, but enough to be unusable."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm half-way through the book and, overall, the subject is presented in a well-structured way and the book is enjoyable. Being myself not a mathematician, I would have liked the book to give more ""intuitions"" on the idea behind the usage of GNN rather than simply formalising everything first and then show some simple examples of its usage (like an idea born by itself that someone later decide to use in real life -- I believe it was the other way round, someone had a problem to solve and so invented GNN and only later they formalized it)."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just started reading this book recently, it surprised me how easily understandable the content is. I have read quite a few books and also watched some tutorials online explaining deep learning, specifically in CNN. Instead of throwing all those maths equations and giving little to zero explanation to them, this book clearly demonstrates how a deep learning neural network works by using simple maths calculations and graphs. This book clears my confusions about deep learning concepts I had before, and I would highly recommend to read it if you are new to machine learning and deep learning."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alles ist gut!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I did love every minute I spent reading this book. For someone like me with 10+ experience in telecom technology and with CV applications increases around us. I was looking for a Gate that helps me close the gap between the lack of computer science foundations and the need to master the latest complicated AI models for CV.This mixture of explaining scientific concepts in simple plain English in addition to well illustrated Math formulas makes it a real distinguished book in Computer Vision. The book that provided me the Gate I needed to close the gap.Concepts are explained in a way that both professionals from industry and researchers from academia would enjoy it.A Million Thanks to the Author
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can compare this one to ""Deep Learning"" by Ian Goodfellow. I've been working as a deep-learning engineer for last 5 years.  I would say this is a great book to kickstart a career in a modern ML / Computer Vision domain. Compared to Goodfellow, it's way more practical in terms of what you need to know to actually build a good a model from scratch. It doesn't go into a deep math background. It doesn't cover 101 research branches that were undertaken in last 20 years but ended up not working in a field. It solely focuses on what exactly is being used in industry these days.On the cons side, I think, to be a good CV engineer there should be a pre-requisite to this book: a more classic computer vision course. So the reader has a better understanding where all those DL techniques should be put in a more broad CV world.Bottomline: Great tutorial. Very easy to digest and get really excited about deep learning."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arguably the best computer vision book on the market. It’s so easy to read and assimilate. It covers all the basics you need to know to build a deep learning model in the CV domain while at the same demystifying the complex things. This was a great purchase!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t review books a lot, but I had to with this one. The book is very well written, has great illustrations, flow, depth and does  a beautiful job explaining ML for machine vision. I can’t recommend it enough."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelente libro de consulta
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Kevin Murphy's book covers all aspects of statistical learning theory in depth and breadth, taking the reader from basic concepts all the way to cutting edge problems. It is a very rare thing, indeed, to find a textbook that is nigh on impossible to fault (Matlab vs R is the only minor niggle for me), in terms of content, style and delivery. The theoretical underpinnings are outlined with care and the motivating examples are well chosen. It serves as a great introduction to statistical inference, machine learning, information theory and graphical models. This book has quickly become my standard reference on the topic and the main recommendation for students."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent book for data mining.  INFINITELY better than most.

Klar teilweise sind die Passagen nur zu meistern, wenn man eigene Motivation verspürt. Legt man diese jedoch an den Tag entwickelt man ein breites Spektrum an Wissen, so erging es immerhin mir!"
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is a good introduction to ML, without going too much into the details of the statistic formulas and algorithms that are used. While the few mathematical expressions in the book could be better explained, the manner topics are introduced is overall very good and clear, with many practical examples that facilitate learning. Other than that, this is probably the best guide if you need a soft introduction to the topic, and you could follow up with ""Data science for business"" from O'Reilly if you need to delve deeper into some of the topics.I would rate it 4 stars if it wasn't for the lack of the table of contents, which makes it really impractical to read."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely one of my top 3 technical book purchases for mathematics in machine learning and data science, out of my approximately 20 books total on these topics. Aggarwal has constructed a text that is both mathematically clear and with a clearly-written progression to more advanced topics in Linear Algebra. I especially purchased this book for more mathematical rigor *and* applications focus in Eigenvectors, Eigendecomposition, Principal Component Analysis, and Singular Value Decomposition;  and Aggarwal has built an admirable construction covering these topics. Reference my photos of the start of the “Applications of Singular Value Decomposition” sections.

It provides a very good coverage of all the background in linear algebra and optimization needed to understand machine learning papers and tools, without having to read separate books on these two topics. This includes specialized topics needed in machine learning, which are not found in introductory books on these topics. There are a lot of good exercises in each chapter, some of which are pretty challenging, and these are very useful in getting a good grasp of the material."

Es un librito interesante, que está bien tener para refrescar conceptos de vez en cuando con ejemplos claros, sencillos y que funcionan perfectamente. Si eres completamente nuevo en la materia, no te servirá de gran ayuda. Es más bien para lectores que ya tienen algún conocimiento sobre el mundo del aprendizaje automático. Como complemento de otras lecturas está muy bien."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Machine Learning is a large domain and a book covering this topic needs to choose carefully what to cover. In Machine Learning Pocket Reference, the author chooses to focus on processing structured data. This means he avoids discussing neural network libraries such as TensorFlow or Natural Language Processing tools like spaCy or NLTK. This conscious decision means he can focus on clear and detailed code examples for solving traditional classification or regression problems using scikit-learn (and other python tools). Each chapter uses concise code samples to walk through how to use many different python packages to work through the multiple steps of a typical machine learning problem. This book is best for someone that has a little bit of exposure to python, pandas and scikit-learn and wishes to learn how to use these tools effectively. It also provides a very good introduction to about 36 other python libraries commonly used in the data science field.If you find yourself looking for quick reminders of how to use functions or are interested in multiple approaches to solving a python data science problem, this book will be a great addition to your bookshelf (real or virtual).One quick note about the size of the book. It is a quick reference so it is suitable for carrying around in your laptop bag. I was a little surprised about the size, so I am attaching an image so you can get a sense for the dimensions of the book."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: The contents is really SOLID! So I will add another star (up to 4) after having had a chance to use it for a while, but I really hope the production issues will be addressed in any future editions.Has good content, but some the provided graphs are just laughable (and almost feel insulting) - they are totally unreadable. E.g., Fig 14-2 on p. 205 is a prime example of this failure. Fig 10-3 on p. 125 isn't that much better, there are others :-(Also, the binding makes it difficult to read the book w/o the fear of breaking the binding. Please consider using a lay-flat binding for this size, or just produce a flatter/thinner book that's larger (yes, no longer pocket size).Trust me, you will need a magnifying glass for some of this, but even that won't make some of the unreadable graphs readable. I've tried."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As Matt (the author) states in the intro to this book, it will not teach you ""from scratch"" data science or machine learning. While not suitable for one's first exposure to the material, it serves an excellent companion piece once you have some foundational data science/ML knowledge and a little bit of Python knowledge (pandas will help too).The book provides a thorough, example-driven treatment of every major step in a DS/ML project, from data cleaning to model evaluation. There's also coverage in terms of many common model scenarios (classification and regression) and the main models within each of those buckets (e.g., Logistic Regression for Classification and Linear/Random Forest for regression). While the book covers a lot of territory relatively speaking, the focus is on practical implications/takeaways versus going through a lot of academic background/boilerplate material. This approach gives the book a nice balance of levity and economy in its delivery.An aspect of the book that I appreciated is that it is very well segmented into terms of individual topics. Often points of interest have their own short section and are not buried in a forest of dense paragraphs. For example, if I wanted to look up something on how to deal with missing data or pre-processing steps, these have separate sections with example code provided.A pleasant surprise from this book was that it exposed me to a somewhat recent data science visualization library Yellowbrick. It's a very handy and easy-to-use library for visualization a lot of common data science charts (e.g., confusion matrix, residual versus predicted value). There are other examples of new data science visualization tools that the reader will be exposed to that I have not seen covered elsewhere (e.g., Shapley).Overall, this is a valuable companion piece either to go through end-to-end or to use as a reference when going through your own data science projects."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like all of the ""For Dummies"" range, this book has lots of detail and goes quite in depth, but in an easy to follow way that's set out clearly. My husband studies and works in this field, and said that he was quite impressed with the book and found it useful"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A pretty nifty intro to machine learning- as usual with the Dummies approach, you get plenty of detail where necessary, but not so much to be mind-boggled and its all delivered in a lively, accessible format that allows you to focus into particular knowledge sectors as you wish. Very useful."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Years ago, I was tasked with getting data from a large and popular search engine company. This company was charging an extortionate amount, plus they were limiting the data available. That impressed on me that APIs and search engines are an easy way to get information in a common and predicable way, but their main purpose on the supply side is to act as a common gateway buffer where self-interest is the main factor. Charges can be made, traffic controlled and data ‘packaged as commodity’ to be sold for easy consumption to third parties. Its how Facebook and Google make their money. Welcome to the real modern web; full of walled gardens and the illusion of open access...It gets better; mobile. We hear all about apps and reactive design, but the truth is that user interfaces have not changed to reflect mobile. A phone is not just a smaller screen; it is something you should be talking into or simply pointing at the real world as a virtual cursor. Whoever decided a mobile screen is just a smaller desktop screen with touch controls really misses the point.How to solve these two issues?1. For complex data you don’t use traditional search gateways and APIs, and often the data you get from them is sanitised for predictability anyway; spider scrape AI is the way forward if you want to make real insights. You then analyse the data yourself rather than rely on third party filtering.2. Chat-bots are the real UI for mobile; a phone is for speaking into. Make your own Cortana or Siri and you don't just have a nice bit of code; you have a start-up that the big boys will want to buy.Both those solutions have one thing in common; machine learning. No longer a thing for science fiction, but the next big enabler for the web.A bit of a ramble perhaps, but the point is clear; its not React Native or Angular 2 that are the things a future-proof developer needs to know. Look a bit further out and its machine learning.So, onto the book.First thing; A dummies book for machine learning is a bit of a misnomer; the subject is not easy, so its not on the same level as 'Mindfulness for Dummies'. Matrix algebra, neural networks and R/python are not beginner subjects, so I would use ‘competent outsider’ rather than 'dummy'. An existing web developer who knows one or two of the the usual web code technologies and who has a decent handle on maths and how asynchronous and asynchronous code work should be fine. Absolute beginners will struggle.Secondly, this is all easy to set up and work through. I’m a JS/Node/Arduino kinda guy and I’ve already flicked through the chapters and followed the first few chapters and it all makes sense even though it is all new. Well written, well graded with clear direction. There are places where things are left unsaid in a 'I'm expecting you to be an existing developer here' way.Why would I or you want to go through the book?Well, to put it bluntly, money. Want to get into Fintech or advanced attribution? This is your primer.The person who can write a good chat-bot, identify users across devices for advertiser targeting (mobile does not have cookies, which incidentally makes all those ‘this site uses cookies’ privacy statements useless because ad-serving no longer uses cookies anyway), acquire complex data through custom search (possibly intelligent page scrape) is the one in demand in the best start-ups right now.The other issue is of course ‘well, this stuff is all on the web anyway, and its more up to date… why do I need a book?’ . True, but try it. I did, and it’s confusing.A structured book is worth its weight in gold, especially one that goes through all the concepts (and what you need to install) in a logical way. The web is for you after you have pieced together all the parts in outline, and know enough to say ‘this thing is important, and that library is just someone trying to put a me-too repo on git for the resume kudos’.Worth noting that this is not a commentary book; it’s a code book for developers. You will be setting up environments and compiling code.Any downsides? Cheap paper, and the previously mentioned 'I expect you to be a developer so I'm skimming a bit here' moments.So overall, what once used to be a niche subject is now already where the big money is. If you work with the web, you need to know machine learning, and this is a good primer."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is another book in the ‘for dummies,’ series, with the same layout – lots of bold headings, text boxes and pointers.  The book promises that you can learn how machine learning algorithms are invaluable, implement machine learning in Python and R and use machine learning to accomplish practical tasks.  Machine learning is an important way to teach your computer how to perform all sorts of tasks, but using it can be quite intimidating.  We teach computing at the college I work at and so I am always on the lookout for interesting books I can buy for our library or which we can implement in our courses. Having read this, I feel it would be useful for students who are being taught this, but I am not at all convinced that it could make me feel confident enough to tackle this from just the book.This book covers the real story of artificial intelligence and machine learning, big data, looking at technologies in the future, installing an R Distribution, coding in R using RStudio, installing a Python distribution, coding in Python using Anaconda, exploring other machine learning tools, demystifying the math behind machine learning, descending the right curve, validating machine learning, starting with simple learners, preprocessing data, leveraging similarity, working with linear models the easy way, hitting complexity with neural networks, going a step beyond using Support Vector Machines, restorting to ensembles of learners, classifying images, scoring opinions and sentiments, recommending products and movies, ten machine learning packages to master and ten ways to improve your machine learning models.If you have some background in the area, this would be useful; like most of the ‘for dummies,’ books, it is clearly laid out.  However, without any specific background in the area, I really do not think I was left with any real ability to apply this.  Still, it would be a good place to start if you are interested in the area and want to get a grasp of what the subject entails."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This isn't the easiest book on the subject - if you're not that confident on maths and would prefer to learn how to visually perform basic analysis, then this perhaps isn't the book for you, because while it doesn't go into full detail on the maths it does explain things in terms of matrix calculations and so on. Nor will it really give you a working knowledge for a particular area - everything is covered in fairly minimal detail. Some of the information is not quite right (some Frequentist statisticians would have a fit at being lumped in with Bayesians, and Bayesian logic has origins as much in insurance as in traditional statistics), although mostly on minor details. However, there's a lot of useful information, and the authors clearly have used a wide range of packages. The problem is that the book doesn't really go into enough detail about everything. Having decided to outline both Python and R, the chapters then tend to introduce a technique and illustrate how to do it in Python OR R, but then only mention packages which may help for the other. It would have been much more sensible to pick one language and stick with it consistently, because that would have built up a more useful starting point, while also saving space to go into a little more depth.I quite like this in one sense, though. While I don't think it's a good starting book for being able to get going immediately, instead it's a decent book if you want to get an idea of just how much you need to learn to understand the topic to a decent level. It mentions data cleaning, feature generation, etc. It outlines a range of tools used by Data Scientists and (very roughly) what they're used for, As a starting point to figure out what to read next to then get a working knowledge, it's potentially quite useful. However, if you want to get started on Machine Learning I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a book that's more focussed on a single programming language and narrower range of techniques and tools."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I found this book very patchy in both writing style and content. This might reflect that there are two authors as there is  definite shift in consistency throughout the book. At times it is accessible but the chapters on the theoretical aspects are too sketchy and confusing, especially the discussion about support vector machines. There are lots of links for going deeper but it would have been better to show by example. While there is example code there is not enough discussion of the output. Like all for Dummies they are trying to get an overview of a subject quickly, but I did not find the book particularly accessible. The chapters on Python and R miss concepts that you need to understand some of the examples and they should either have missed this out and said that readers need a Python or R book to read along, or expanded them as at the minute they are a partial solution.Why they cover single value decomposition in the last chapters and not in the beginning when they first talk about principal components analysis is a mystery. But this is typical of the non-linear way topics are introduced. This lack of flow makes it hard to follow. There are good points, such as the examples and the chapters at the end where they show implementations (although they lack details on the outputs) and also the links to resources, but overall I was underwhelmed."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Once again, although they say this book is a Dummies guide, you have to be a reasonably smart dummy. Having recently reviewed ""Weapons of Math Destruction""   Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy           this fell on the doormat and my interest was immediately gripped.It's not an easy read, that is don't expect the slightly patronising style of earlier Dummies books; but it is a clear introductory text and for a rank outsider like myself it provides a practical way into this fascinating and important subject. It's full of web addresses to check out, often several to a page,  and I felt that I wished I had an eBook version - where I presume the links would have been alive. It starts by talking about AI and ML and comparing them. I found the writing style engaging and drawing me in a credit to the editors and authors, and once we had moved from that part of theory and into programming I found myself wanting to have a go - this is not a subject I'm familiar with, but it had engaged me.On the whole, as an introductory text, this is another good sign that the Dummies guides are maturing and prepared to tackle difficult subjects in a way that an averagely intelligent person can pick up and learn from. Recommended for the curious."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was exactly the book I was looking for! It introduces the concepts briefly but very well.  Then it describes the code necessary to implement them in python. Many books or online courses focus on explaining the concepts, like 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' or  MIT 6.034. This book is a magnificent supplement for them, which help you to apply the concepts and learn by doing.One guy critized that the book is printed in greyscale. That's indeed true. It should not be an issue though:-you can distinguish the elements even in greyscale - just consider his example, every element is different so you do not need different colors-the book is supposed to be used while coding in python (which shows all elements in different colors).If the color issue bothered you, I can tell you it should not. If you were looking for a more technical introduction into machine learning, you might find 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' a more useful alternative."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: Geron's book is much longer than this one (856 pages vs 400) and almost two-thirds of Geron's is about deep learning. This review is comparing this book to the first third of Geron's book. This book only provides several pages on deep learning (neural nets), similar to the other models. I would suggest this book for a basic foundation and if you want to dig into the minutiae of deep learning read the last 430 pages of Geron.I read the Geron book ""Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-learn & TensorFlow"" before reading this book. This book provides a better start for several reasons. First, it is better organized. Second, the code implementations rely primarily on Python modules, instead of custom programming.Regarding the first, this book is set-up so that a reader can get an understanding of Machine Learning (ML) step-by-step from the bottom-up. For instance, supervised learning, feature engineering, and model evaluation all get separate chapters. The model evaluation chapter provides an entire section, as well as graphics, for understanding the roles of training, validation, and test data, which are probably the most important bedrock concepts in ML. In contrast to this, Geron throws you right into an entire ML pipeline in the second chapter. It's a mix of feature engineering, linear models, stochastic gradient descent, random forest models, cross-validation, grid search, and even object oriented programming for custom transformers! This might be useful for quickly understanding what ML is like in practice. If later sections of Geron then went step-by-step and elaborated on the second chapter, it would be great. Instead, for instance, the second chapter is randomly about binary classification for image data. You only get two paragraphs in the first chapter on cross-validation and validation sets, and a sentence or two later in the book. I had to go to Wikipedia to ensure that I understood it correctly and robustly. I wish I had read this book instead.Regarding the second, this book does not assume a heavy programming background. Most of the ML pipeline is taught through the Python module Scikit-Learn. This is useful because the programming does not distract from learning fundamentals of ML. In contrast, in the second chapter of Geron, there is object oriented programming code involving concepts like constructors and inheritance. For this book, the most sophisticated chapter at the end, which is on pipelines and which expertly explains why feature engineering should be performed during model evaluation, doesn't even go into this. Some reviews mention that the author uses an mglearn Python package that he wrote. It is true that when he uses functions from this package the code is concealed. Arguably, this prevents readers who aren't familiar with Python from getting distracted by code that is unrelated to machine learning (such as creating visualizations). At times I was curious about how some of the code was working in the background (it is all available on GitHub), but the book's job is not to cover all aspects of data analysis with Python (which would be a separate book).In summary Geron teaches more advanced topics interspersed with the basics without an entirely coherent organizational structure. This book has an intuitive structure that elaborates at length on core ML concepts and doesn't overburden with moderate-to-complex programming."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The purpose of this text, to cover ""all the important aspects of implementing machine learning without requiring you to take advanced math courses"", is its greatest weakness. If you're looking to obtain anything more than the most rudimentary of understandings of how the included ML algorithms function, either mathematically or programmatically, you won't find satisfactory explanations in this text. The problem is that some of these algorithms simply require a detailed explanation, and stripping out or barely touching on the technical details just leads to confusion.Another issue is the mglearn library that is required for this text. It is a huge annoyance because it obscures code that is otherwise necessary to understand if you have any intention of transferring the information in this text to the real world.Some general concepts are explained well, but clarity begins to decline as topics become more complex. Almost all the code is poorly explained. Expect to spend as much time, if not more, examining the documentation for the referenced libraries as you will reading this text if you hope to get anything useful out of it."

Thus, this book is perfect for the practitioner, but does not attempt to teach the theory or mathematics behind the algorithms."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As a data scientist and machine learning practitioner I was disappointed in this book.  Admittedly the authors faced the very difficult task of trying to communicate the relationship of two very deep and technical subjects: malware analysis and machine learning.  The result, unfortunately, is a work that is only the barest introduction to both.The first half of the book dips a toe in the ocean of malware static analysis, dynamic analysis, and reverse engineering.  Not knowing anything about malware, this section of the book did indeed spark my curiosity and supply me with strong motivation to continue my studies in malware analysis with other, more comprehensive resources.The second half of the book is a shallow overview of basic, elementary topics in machine learning and common tools used by practitioners.  This overview is accompanied by proof-of-concept applications to malware detection.  The machine learning overview will not supply any new knowledge to anyone who has any practical experience in machine learning and for a complete beginner it is insufficient even as a first course.In summary, this is not a bad book as the authors are clearly technically proficient, good writers, and passionate about their area of expertise.  Nonetheless, be aware that if you are not already an expert in malware AND machine learning you will need to follow up this short read with much more detailed sources.  If you are already proficient in both subjects than you will already understand how to apply machine learning to malware analysis to the level of basic examples found in this book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved this book, it gives you a quick intro to disassemble and ""reverse engineering"", and it states that if you want to go deeper you can read Practical Malware analysis, which I think could be the next level of this book, from there it's just a roller coaster of binary data analysis, data visualization and coding. Joshua and Hillary made a good job at keeping the code readable, while teaching some key concepts on ML and deep learning, data visualization and analysis. In the end, the book not only feeds you with plenty of information, but also is able to give you new ideas."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It says absolute beginners don’t think so, l thought I would read it as I’ve read a few books on AI and thought a very basic understanding of the programming behind would be beneficial. I found this book mind numbing I did follower some of it but overall an effort to read."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the kindle edition and it's been 9 days since I purchased it. I can't even return this book now and it's an absolute pain to read through. Most of the codes work but there are mistakes in some of the codes. I worked through Chapter 3 and I found at least two such cases.  Sample codes are provided through github in the form of jupyter notebook and chapter 3 codes don't run as provided. Outputs for that notebook were not included, so I doubt the author even ran it once before publishing the codes. It's not hard to fix the mistakes in the code but the provided codes should work.For kindle edition, yhat is printed as ybar. That's not a big deal but it is misleading if you don't have a background in stats or other related fields."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is another excellent book from the For Dummies stable.  Clear, well-organised and approachable.  And the subject is right up there at the cutting edge of computing.  Back in the olden days when I learned programming it was all reports and maths - now, here we are teaching computers to learn and to think.  It is brilliant stuff!  This book will take you through the basics from an overview of AI and how machines learn, to the two main languages (R and Python) you need, and how to use them - and what the programs you create can do for you.  It covers installation and use of programs on all home computer compatible operating systems: Linux, Windows and Mac.Machine learning has amazing possibilities - it enables computers to learn from the real world and this has so many applications: sales, medicine, criminology, automotive functions and so much more.  It is amazing - and this excellent book makes a great first text for anyone studying or wanting to study the subject."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's kind of interesting, when you hear about machine learning and AI on podcasts and on TV, it always sounds so futuristic and abstract for us 'normal' folk. But his book helped me to see it doesn't seem so unattainable to get into this field. Yes, you need to have programming skills and a strong grasp of classical statistics but these are useful skills to have in a data-minded world anyway. I will leave it a few days before I decide to dive deeper into ML, but this book has certainly inspired me to look at it more closely as a potential hobby or career tangent."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'd give six stars if I could. It's a really useful and mostly understandable book for beginners. Kudos to the author
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is very frustrating. I found it difficult to follow and read due to the structure. I also found the text very dry, and certainly not something that is accessible to beginners (or ""dummies"" that are new to the subject). It is poorly organised and I'm not sure who it is aimed at or who would benefit from this book.The book spends a lot of time on R and Python, and how they can be used for various tasks. This is good, but I think it spends a lot of time on the basics of installing the programmes (fair enough it is a dummies book) but not enough time on actual practical examples that people would use. It seems like the authors started off writing a ""dummies"" book and then forgot and just started rambling in various directions, definitely not user friendly. There is a lot of text and I find it rather overwhelming for a subject I'm not familiar with and I would prefer more graphics and figures.This book had the potential to be very good, but unfortunately it is poorly structured and hard to follow. The authors are very knowledgeable but the final product is not what I would expect for a ""dummies"" book."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using Microsoft Machine Learning for the last few weeks so was interested to read this book, although it doesn’t cover MML specifically, but I thought it might provide some interesting background and alternative tools to use.I have to say that I found this book to be very theoretical for large parts. I know the Dummies books are designed so you don’t have to read them from cover to cover, but there is too much theory in this book. It covers R and Python and various tools and libraries you need to access ML. The first 200 pages slowly set the scene, covering the basics of the two languages, some of the maths behind ML and some of the libraries you need to use.There are too few worked examples and too little code. I wonder if the authors were more interested in getting a book that won’t go out of date quickly than proving one that might be useful. The book is ok for some of the background knowledge but not hot on the practical side."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For an in depth discussion of AI I would suggest you look elsewhere e.g., Margaret Boden has been writing on the topic for years,   AI: Its nature and future          .  Machine learning is an aspect of AI. An internet search on MYCIN, a project dating back to 1970s indicates how long people have been conducting research on all of this.This book gives you a succinct overview of the issues, and then gets you started using R and Python to try a few things out yourself.  Not at rocket science level but enough to set you off and thinking about it to the point where you will be better informed about stuff around you and possibly developing your own ideas. It's well written.  If you are interested in the subject the book won't get in the way."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"In a nutshell, the value of reading Murphy's Machine Learning highly depends on what you expect to get out of it.------------------As a graduate student who had read a descent number of papers in the field, I feel very conflicted about this textbook.------------------If you expect to teach yourself machine learning from this textbook, this is in my opinion almost surely *not* the textbook to get.  (0/5 Stars)-The content of the textbook is highly disorganized.  Future chapters are constantly referenced in the text (as if you have already read them!).  Perplexingly, meaningful explanations of concepts are often delayed by multiple chapters. (Ex. BIC is introduced in Ch.6 but a mathematical justification is provided only in Ch. 8 when the mathematical justification could have (and should have) been in Ch. 6).-A number of topics are merely mentioned (like VC dimension) but not actually discussed at any reasonable length, making some sections of the textbook meaningless.-I would instead recommend the related (but different) text Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R as it is quite accessible.-----------However, if you are an instructor and wish to use this textbook as a supplement to a course or are a researcher then Murphy's Machine Learning is in my opinion could be a worthwhile purchase.  (4/5 stars)-The examples, references and illustrations give the textbook a particularly nice touch.  (I particularly enjoyed the example of calculating the posterior probability of user ratings of two different items on Amazon).In summary, if you are an instructor that wants their students to learn how to read challenging exposition to prepare them for reading research papers in the field or if you wish to use this as a reference, then this is a good choice.  Otherwise, pass."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this book for a couple of years now. I was initially turned off by the 'Bayesian' attitude of the author(full disclosure: I'm a trained frequentist statistician) however with a coupe of years of experience in applied MLas well as reading other ML/Stat. Learning books, I find that this book provides me with the most cohesive andcomprehensive framework for understanding and using ML  algorithms/models. It has definitely become my'gold standard' for reviewing ML related concepts. I find this author's notation and terminology the most usefulcompared to other books. Also the author stresses the separation of the model from the algorithm. ""This kind ofmodularity, where we distinguish the model from the algorithms, is good pedagogy and good engineering"" - the author. I agree.However, for a newbie to ML, I would not recommend this book as your primary source. It can serve as asecondary source or reference."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm an economist with many years of experience building & using time-series ""scenario"" models.  This book makes evident that many techniques used in econometric model-building are also used in Machine Learning (ML) & share common technical foundations.  Understanding these communalities makes it a lot easier to communicate with non-economist data scientists.At a practical level, the book provides technical explains & provides solid technical rationale for a lot of modelling tricks I've used in the past, & suggested some very clever new ones.This book is accessible for anyone with a background in reasonably advanced econometrics, say at level of W. H. Greene Econometrics (8th Ed, 2018)."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is a bit of a mixed bag.  It is more current than Bishop's book and on paper more complete, but the writing quality varies from chapter to chapter.  I think it is best used as a complement to good lecture notes as it is more encyclopedic in nature.  The didactic quality is great in some chapters, especially the early ones, but skimpy in the more advanced topics.  A great positive of this book is the accompanying software is readily available online.On the whole a great book to have on your shelf if you are serious about AI, but not on its own.  As far as the typos, they are pretty easy to spot so they were not a concern."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm just wrapping up a machine learning course using this text, and I'm not a fan. The book is in dramatic need of an editor, and the index is bordering on useless. (Neither of the entire chapters on logistic or linear regression are findable via the index.) Frequently I've encountered a reference to an acronym that isn't defined in the current chapter, and isn't in the book's index. And it seems like every time I read a passage from this book I find some kind of spelling, capitalization, grammar or formatting error.I don't find the book to be very readable or good for initially learning material from, but it does seem to have a pretty complete appraisal of the techniques composing each individual concept in ML, which is useful as a jumping off point for googling."

The software that accompany's the book is excellent, lends clarity to the text, and is useful to the practitioner.Disappointingly however - the software has been archived at google and moved to git hub - so the code library no longer works with respect to automatically downloading data, which is a big part of what makes it so nice, as you can then run the examples which use that data. It is not clear if the data files can be downloaded from git hub or not. There does not seem to be any information regarding this to be found which seems to indicate their is not a lot of active development going on with the software. If it were not for this problem I would give it 5 stars in a second."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is very useful in learning advanced uses for python in data science.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A healthy discussion of the skills and techniques you'll need to perform best-practices machine learning and data science. Very concise code examples and practical demos!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great book, and I'd say it is even great for those that are not familiar with python (you just obviously won't be able to run the code). For anyone with some basic understanding of linear algebra/statistics, the authors are able to present to you all the important (and sometimes subtle but significant) details, without the usage of equations, and more importantly, how they all relate to one another.All the concepts mentioned here are heavily backed with well thought of and well presented figures, in such a way that again I'd suggest you don't even need python to understand. If you do know python, loading the data sets and reproducing the figures is just a few lines of easy to understand code away (with the exception of the mglearn library includes which does some ""plotting magic"" for you. However, I believe each of them were appropriate. You can ignore them and make the plots in your own way, or just print the variables, it just may not look as publication friendly).Normally, I hesitate purchasing books that claim they may explain algorithms without the need of equations, and I expect them rather to be cook books of lightly and disjointly explained techniques (like an encyclopedia). However, I do not think such is true of this book. The power of scikit-learn is demonstrated and the algorithms behind them explained intuitively, and are referred as to how they fit together and complement each other.As with any introductory read, a supplement is needed from time to time and the authors' reference to Elements of Statistical Learning is a useful one (equation heavy). There are points in the book where the author defers to elements of statistical learning. I found these points suitable since further explanation would be out of scope.I read this book on my free time while on vacation, and much of the time I didn't have access to a computer. The concepts were so well presented that it was just a nice leisurely read. When I finally had time to access a computer, I was able to try the techniques on my data sets with some browsing back and forth through the book again, but otherwise with little effort.Finally, since I myself am a researcher, I would recommend this book to any other researcher willing to start delving into the world of machine learning. Further reading will always be necessary, but this book will give you such a good intuitive understanding and overview of the subject matter that you'll know what to do to proceed next, and how to do it without running in circles. Even better, you'll likely already have applied it to your research!"

Each chapter is devoted on one concept/technique. Every chapter starts by first explaining intuition and some theory about the concept, and then step-by-step explains how to apply it to solve a practical problem using TensorFlow. Another good thing is that this book covers a wide variety of domains such as ""predicting stock prices"", ""playing pacman"", and ""sentiment analysis"" which gives you a great flavour of how these concepts are used to solve real-world problems.It's a very lively book filled with charts and figures. It's great for both beginner students as well as practicing data-scientists. Highly recommended!"

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very excited prior to receiving this book. I have previously read a number of ML and AI textbooks, most of which typically focussed on Python. Given my broader background in .NET I thought this book would be excellent.Unfortunately, in many cases the content is very superficial and lacks any real depth.The author refers to colours on graphs at times throughout the book, but the book is B&W?I also found that the code example snippets were not very well aligned in places, making it difficult to read the examples.The author is correct when he recommends a solid understanding of C# to use this book. However, the problem is not the complexity of the code, but that certain aspects of code examples are missing entirely, and without knowing how to find the correct 'system types' in the relevant Microsoft.ML namespaces you will be stuck.If the full code was provided, in a more logical order, including all of the relevant 'using' statements, then even beginners in C# could probably use this book. In the current state however, it is difficult to navigate.On the upside, the author provides access to the GitHub repo, which does include all of the source code presented in the book, and this is well formatted. Therefore, for readers with experience using Git and Version Control, I recommend ignoring the code snippets in the book entirely and instead using the GitHub repo.Although, quite frankly, this should not be necessary - the book should offer adequate guidance without needing to search for further online resources.For readers who are keen to learn the fundamentals of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, I would recommend the following two books:1. Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems, 2nd Ed. (Géron, A., 2019).2. Deep Learning with Python (Chollet, F. 2017).They cover the depth of these topics in far more detail.Only tackle this book if you already understand Machine Learning and you are very adept at using .NET, specifically C#.Thank you."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The book delineates five classic classification models of Machine Learning. This oversimplified discussion is clear and concise.However there is no supporting code or array of examples to ground the theory. Also, the graphs are only two dimensional and there is no references to various software libraries to support these concepts.Generally, this book is only one quarter written and I have scored it accordingly."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super livre pour s'initier à la fois à l'analyse de données et aux différents outils : Excel, Python, R"
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sadly I have to say this is a useless book. Author has weak understanding of basic concepts of statistics and analytics. As consultant, the author goal for the reader is to fake it till you make it. Rather than explaining the concepts, the author just provides a checklist for the reader to pretend how to do Analytics.Some examples of his lack of knowledge:Author says discrete variables are commonly used as continuous because when the mean of a discrete variable is calculated, we obtain a continuous value. No shame to show his complete ignorance.Rather than explain the difference between sample and population, author suggests always to use the formulas for samples. Can anyone be lazier?"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have currently only read just over 100+ pages in this book and it has been the most useful 100 pages of information that I have come across. This is saying a lot as someone who is not only a Data Analyst for a Fortune 500 company. Also, I am someone who has completely immersed myself in so many tutorials, books, webinars, classes, articles, etc. in search of the right material to really understand data analytics. George Mount had me sold on this book when hearing him speak on Excel, R, and Python in a way that just makes so much more sense than the common narrative of bashing Excel and putting R and Python in competition with each other. He talks with nuance about how they each have their roles. He understands the real-to-life uses of each of these tools that can help one to see that he knows exactly what he's talking about. This book is not just another book in a vast space of so MANY resources out there (believe me, I know first hand). This book has easily risen to the top of any content that I have been in front of up to this point and I will owe George the greatest thanks when my career really takes off further. I gladly would have paid George my college tuition for this one book instead.Lastly, if you are in your career as a data analyst, looking to how you can start a career in data analytics, a student at a university. Just save yourself so much heartache and pain. Pick up this book and know that it can have a major ROI as it has done for me.Thank you, George"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Mr. Mount obviously knows his subject matter, but what impressed me most was his ability to convey complex concepts in an accessible way. The book is full of graphs, charts, examples, ""tips"" and ""warnings"" that bring light to the topics. The tone is personal, yet to the point. Mr. Mount's objective is not to impress readers with his own considerable knowledge, but to gently guide them to develop their own skill set. After reading the book, I felt as if I'd just had a pleasant conversation with a very good, and very intelligent, friend. Well worth the money. I hope Mr. Mount continues to write."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great book of Machine Learning
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is a tough read -- it really should be called 'Machine Learning Programming for Dummies'.  It seeks to split its focus between the concepts of machine learning and the associated implementation, but really doesn't do a good job in either.  It potentially could be used as a reference tool for various tools, acronyms, jargon, and concepts, but is not a good book to become familiar with the concepts of machine learning and how they compare to 'traditional' deterministic software principles.  Additionally, the samples and use cases it presents are not well organized in a simple way, making it hard to learn via example (e.g. here's a business problem, here's a hypothesis related to that problem, here's the data available, now let's see if machine learning can help)."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm sure if you are a Google Research Scientist and are not learning the material for the first time, this book is amazing. For everyone else, I would not recommend it. I bought this book for my Fall 2013 COMPSCI 571 class, and I regret it. Before buying this book, consider the following:1. Take a look at the online Errata. This book is already in it's 3rd printing and it just came out. The list of corrections for this (the 3rd edition) is already mind-numbingly long. The 4th printing coming out this month will surely fix some errors, but there are just too many.2. Our class has an online forum (for a 100 person class) where we discuss topics, and most questions are either (a) basic topics from the book that no one understood or (b) talking about how one figure in the book has multiple errors associated with it. At first I was really excited to find mistakes and submit them to the Errata - it was like I was part of the book! Now I just get frustrated and have already given up on submitting corrections.3. Our instructor regrets using this book and modifies the examples before giving them to us in class. Our out of class readings now consist mostly of MetaAcademy.com.4. There are hardly any worked-through examples, and many of those that are worked through have errors.5. Many important concepts are skimmed over way too quickly. For example, there is a whole chapter on Logistic regression. However, Logistic regression is covered for exactly 2 pages. Then a weird 3D graph is presented but not explained (a common theme throughout the book is graphs that look absolutely amazing, but which convey little information as to exactly what's going on to a lay-person like me), then the rest of the chapter presents methods for doing the math, which I'm sure are useful in some sense, but I'm still thinking: ""why is this MLE not in closed form, what is a Hessian doing here... and wtf is going on?!""Most students just got the PDF for free online, and I would highly suggest doing something other than paying $55 for this book."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've read the first 6 chapters and I don't think this book is for beginner of ML. It's not a good purchase as a introductory book. That's fine.

Cons is that it covers broad important topics in ML and it's still good to keep a copy."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Review of the kindle version. The content is ok so far, but many variables are not defined in the text or the notation section. In other cases, variables are used as they are vernacularly in the field; in many of these cases, this is not the precise use of the variable. Texts should be precise and not take up idiosyncratic notations of practitioners. This sloppy production makes it hard to objectively review the content.Aside from this book, I am very dissatisfied with mathematical notation in kindle books, FWIW."

Unfortunately I don't know other books on the topic, but I've read much better math|stats|CS books (for contrast, check out Convex optimization by Boyd: that's pure clarity all the way).

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been developing rapidly in recent years in terms of software algorithms, hardware implementation, and applications in a vast number of areas. In this book, the writer (PARAG MAHAJAN, MD) has smoothly explained the latest developments of applications of AI in biomedicine, including disease diagnostics, living assistance, biomedical information processing, and biomedical research. The aim of this book (Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: AI, Machine Learning, and Deep and Intelligent Medicine Simplified for Everyone) is to keep track of new scientific accomplishments, to understand the availability of technologies, to appreciate the tremendous potential of AI in biomedicine, and to provide researchers in related fields with inspiration. It can be asserted that, just like AI itself, the application of AI in biomedicine is still in its early stage. New progress and breakthroughs will continue to push the frontier and widen the scope of AI application, and fast developments are envisioned in the near future.Furthermore, this book expounds on the current healthcare system and its effect on patient welfare.  If we move our eye in history, we come to know that physicians have too much workload. Due to this, they could not communicate properly with patients and give them proper guidelines, and the effect of this poor communication - decreased patient trust in doctors. The research shows that 99% of all human communication is based on body language, while only 7% is dependent on the exchange of words. This book shows that patients are not waiting for the doctors to explain everything about their health in today's era, but they use AI, like; smartwatches, fitness bands, smart oximeters, and glucometers connected to their smartphones and can easily know their health status.In addition, the writer plays a pivotal role in explaining the main reason for NOT using AI - resistance by doctors. According to him, physicians think that AI will replace the job of doctors, but in reality, it is not like that. AI will help the doctors work faster, save time, and do various research like the COVID symptom tracker app launched in the US and the UK to determine COVID cases. As per the recent report of the FDA, the AI is secure, and data is only visible to patients, not everyone. In the area of assisted living for elderly and disabled people, AI applications using corresponding smart robotic systems are paving the way for improvements in life quality. An overview of smart home functions and tools offered for people with loss of autonomy (PLA) and intelligent solution models based on wireless sensor networks, data mining, and AI was published recently. NNs can be trained with specific image-processing steps to recognize human facial expressions as commands. Furthermore, human-machine interfaces (HMIs) based on facial expression analysis allow people with disabilities to control wheelchairs and robot assistance vehicles without a joystick or sensors attached to the body.In addition to it, the writer has perfectly mentioned the myths about AI and the solutions too. People think that AI will replace doctors, and the consequences of this replacement will be poverty and loss of economy. Another myth is AI models are biased and 3rd myth is, AI is too risky to use in healthcare, and the last myth is AI means the end of privacy. Telling these myths, the writer has clearly said that these are false statements and not to believe these. He advises to implement AI in surgeries, radiology workflows, scans tests, and so on, and said, ""AI is serendipity; it is here to liberate us from monotonous jobs and makes us more human.""In conclusion, I give a 5-star rating because through this book, readers will come to know about every application, implementation, and AI process in our daily lives from micro to macro applications. The works of machines for the betterment of humans are admirably mentioned in this book. The writer has put some light on AI in almost every medical field and its usage like; pulmonology, pediatrics, oncology,  obstetrics,  gynecology, neurology, neurosurgery, nephrology, rheumatology, nursing, physical therapy, and several others.  It has been predicted that AI will hit healthcare in the most shocking way. The anticipated steps include: care and management of chronic disease, increasing the availability of health data of patients, environmental and socio-economic facets of medicine, and precision medicine and genetic information integrated with care management."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I feel excited whenever I get the opportunity to read and write about an ascendent technology like AI or ML or something else. After reading the book's title, ""Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare,"" I was more curious to read it. The author has placidly explained the advantages of artificial intelligence (AI), machine-learning algorithms, and software in healthcare to mimic human cognition in the analysis, presentation, and comprehension of complex medical and health care data, i.e., AI in healthcare shows the immense possibilities in customizing care delivery or delivering solutions based on an individual patient's genetic, lifestyle, location, and environmental factors. It spans the treatment journey from diagnosis to disease detection, prognosis, and management.This book astonishingly answers all of our questions, like what happens when things go wrong? How are the end-users educated? Reasons why everyone should acquaint to it? And goes on! Besides, this book elucidates the current healthcare system and its impact on patient well-being. We all know that everyone in today's era is more conscious about their health. This book clarifies that AI plays a crucial role in knowing each health status (like smartwatches, fitness bands, intelligent oximeters, and glucometers connected to their smartphones and can quickly understand their health status). The author splendidly said that ""AI is luck; it is here to free us from tedious jobs and proffers us more human.""This book will positively be adorable for those who want to be or are interested in the vanguard of the latest advancements worldwide with accurate data. It will open up new prospects for you in the field of Artificial Intelligence and will surely increase your concern. I feel like the author has a magnificent way of explaining things. I relished this book, and I believe you would also. Overall, An informative piece, highly recommended!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m sure we’re all somewhat familiar now with the concept of artificial intelligence (AI), with many of us relying heavily upon it in our day-to-day life in the form of our smartphones, smart home devices and even our online banking. It is clear that AI is simply a part of our life now, whether you like it or not, and we’re all becoming a little more dependent upon its use with every day that passes. While these typical everyday uses I can get my head around, something as complex as the use of AI within the healthcare system has been an area, I admit, I’d never really thought much about before. With news outlets presenting argument outlining the pitfalls of technology one day and singing their praises the next, it’s difficult to know whether this new future of AI is something to be pleased about or not, never mind throwing something as serious and essential as healthcare into the mix!It is therefore all the more impressive, then, what Dr Parag Suresh Mahajan has managed to create with this book – a detailed yet incredibly readable examination of the potential benefits of the use of AI within the healthcare system, myth busting and answering any questions you may have along the way. I’ll freely admit that I’m not the most technologically minded – there have been days when the simplest of computer tasks completely alludes me – but I had no problem at all following along with the author’s arguments, reasoning and discussion. It was a fascinating read and opened my eyes in terms of the many uses of AI and how it could be harnessed to better improve our healthcare systems. With public interest in health and wellbeing at an all-time high thanks to the widespread use of smartwatches and fitness bands, employing this technology further to create a more personalised approach to heath is surely the way of the future.From diagnosis to disease detection, prognosis to management, the author has expertly and succinctly explained the many ways in which AI can be used in order to better apply complex medical data to deliver a custom care experience for the patient. In this way, he explains, a completely unique service can be offered based on an array of factors, from lifestyle to genetics, creating a plan utterly unique and designed with the patient at the centre. This is a rather stark contrast to the ‘one size fits all’ approach to healthcare that we’re probably used to dealing with and reading about its potential use within healthcare was absolutely captivating. That’s not so say that Dr Parag shies away from discussing the potential issues as resistances to AI – whether it be the future of doctors and nurses, the invasion of privacy or the risks attached with using personal healthcare data in such a way, the author provides balanced and detailed responses to any myths or potential problems that may arise. I appreciated the inclusion of the possible negative side of AI alongside the good, which helped to provide a clear and well-rounded argument that I’m sure you’ll be thinking about long after closing the book.Overall, this was a fascinating and incredibly informative discussion into the uses of AI that will open you up to a new way of thinking about technology, data and the way in which it can be harnessed. Whether you’re already interested in the subject or you’d just like a little more information, this is a fantastic read that will, I’m sure, give you plenty to think and talk about. I highly recommend!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this book, I’ll be taking discrete math over the summer and wanted to get a jump start on the subject. I usually use khan academy but seems they didn’t have a dedicated section on this subject I needed to find another way to get introduced to this stuff and this book, with examples in python, has really been great for me. If you don’t have any experience in things like Boolean algebra or logic it may be a bit confusing at first, but if you already got a bit of a foundation in these things this book will be a breeze."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, an algorithm led me to this book!  (Yeah, AI at work.)  I doubt I would ever have otherwise considered such a lofty title.Not being a medical practitioner, but an avid reader, I found this book fascinating.  The intro and first section are very clear and apprehendable to the lay reader.You'll discover an alphabet soup of definitions.  think, AI, ML, AAN, DL.  These are all acronyms we hear, and ""sort of"" figure out what they mean by their context.  This book explains them, and how they relate to one another.By chapter six of section two, I was in deep weeds, and decided to do some skimming forward.  (This is a nearly 600 page book.)I found it soon became more readable and relatable. There is an excellent section on the ethics of AI.  And Section 5, on AI and Covid was especially interesting.In several places, there are lists of medical specialties and descriptions of how AI can or will be used in those specialties.  It was fun reading about the areas about which I knew a little.There is a section on myths about AI in healthcare that was also very helpful. It was interesting reading for me and seldom became overwhelming.  It has many charts and diagrams to make the explanations visual.  I especially enjoyed learning about how computers ""read"" images.This book is well written.  Its audience seems to be medical practitioners or students in allied health, but it is very readable by a layperson such as myself.If you are at all interested in AI, this book will be a great read."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a comprehensive look at the changing face of medicine. Covid vastly increased the use of telemedicine. What most consumers don’t know is that the evolution of Artificial Intelligence is moving at a pace that might give patients and healthcare professionals whiplash if they attempt to study all of these developments individually. The author has packaged the current status of AI in Healthcare into a very accessible book. The terminology and techniques presented can be understood by the typical lay person. Having this resource will enable today’s patients to be informed when discussing their own health concerns with their doctor. More impressive to me is the pace of development of self-monitoring healthcare artificial intelligence that can be obtained through the internet and smart devices such as phones, watches, and other monitors.Because AI is increasingly used in making medical decisions, patients may become concerned about ethical decision making. This topic is included in the volume as well and the topics presented may be shocking to the reader(such as how the machine can learn bias through its algorithmic program and input of data).As frightening as AI in healthcare might seem, it has moved healthcare forward in a number of ways: diagnosis, monitoring, screening, surgical and treatment accuracy, drug and equitable development to name a few.During this post-Covid era, the section on the use of AI for screening, social distancing, and treatment development is particularly interesting. Recommended reading for those who take charge of their own healthcare and want to stay abreast of these issues."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book covers a wide spectrum of deep learning topics. I've spent several hours reading it and can assure you that it contains everything you need to succeed in this skill. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that allows computers to learn from their mistakes and comprehend the world as a hierarchy of concepts. There is no need for a human-computer operator to expressly specify all of the knowledge that the computer requires because the computer learns through experience. A graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep, allowing the machine to understand sophisticated concepts by building them out of simpler ones."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased two introductory e-books on Machine Learning. One cost me $20 and this one cost me $3. The $20 book had 399 pages but I got so completely lost before hitting page 100 that I gave up in defeat. (My iPad Kindle app doesn’t have page numbers, so I can’t tell you exactly what page I was on but it seemed like I had been reading forever).Then I found this $3 book – Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners – was not only short but it came out as the clear winner because I was able to get through right to the end of it with ease and without confusion. So turns out I got more than my money’s worth here with this book!And on top of that, this book was clear, well-written and a definite confidence builder. The knowledge I’ve gained from this book regarding ML models and basic algorithms gives me more confidence to go back to the other more expensive book for a second attempt.In summary, if this is your first foray into Machine Learning then this here is your book! It is the perfect stepping stone to other more lengthy options."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is short and moves along fairly well. What do you get? The author gives an overview of data science that distinguishes machine learning from data mining, artificial intelligence, etc. I found this useful. He gives specific examples of how machine learning is implemented in marketing and elsewhere. Different types of algorithms, some supported by humans and some not, do the machine learning or data mining or other data science. The author does not go into great depth on these algorithms, which is consistent with his goal of providing an overview for beginners.The book has some math. Once again, I think this is included to alert a beginner that understanding and working with math is mandatory to work in this field. The author lists job titles and salary ranges for jobs in the data science/machine learning fields.If you or someone you know think that data science may be a career in which you would be interested, I recommend the book."

Given how big the scope is, each chapter maps to an entire field it's challenging to finish this book and feel like you're a domain expert in all of them.No book, especially one this short will give you that deep of an understanding on that wide of a topic. However, seeing the DeepChem code examples taught me more about Chemistry than perhaps my entire high school education.The only reason I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because the quality of the book degrades near the end and sort of becomes a cookbook for random ML techniques like using GANs for drug discovery. However, the computational Chemistry and protein folding chapters are exceptional and are the only reference I'm aware of that explains this stuff so simply and with so much code."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Terrific book for folks looking to understand the basics of machine learning and handful of applications across life sciences. The book takes a really thoughtful step-by-step approach and also gives the opportunity to run the code to get a real understanding of the technology. I’m not a programmer so even skipping those examples I learned a ton about ML and broad range of use cases in the life sciences from tox and binding predictions to microscopy and imagine analysis to electronic medical records. Great book. Highly recommended if you want to get smart on this area. Skip the review papers and dive into this!
,1.0 out of 5 stars,There are technical details but the book is not particularly insightful nor practical.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's a nice book. I would have liked it to be more in depth but I guess it's meant to be for casual readers.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I received Deep Learning specifically to write a review.  That said, I try to be honest and open in all my reviews.(Please see the enclosed pictures.)I loved the level of detail in the book.  It showed the deep learning code as well as demonstrated where to find data for learning and training systems.The book took just the right level of technical depth both to be credible as well as remain interesting and allow the reader to engage in learning.You can see from the table of contents just how much information is packed into this small book.My one caveat is that much of the book revolves around using the DeepChem program that is only available for Mac and Linux users.Chapter two alone is worth four stars as it is a detailed, but approachable description of deep learning.If you are a Mac or Linux user then the review jumps to five stars.As a Windows user, you are going to struggle a bit and have to imagine what the code might have done had you run it.All in all, read this as a primer on life sciences and how they relate to potential deep learning applications.If you are a Mac or Linux user then go beyond the basics and learn how to do some basic deep learning programming."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a really nice introduction to a variety of health science applications.  I was particularly interested in the drug discovery chapter.  The discussion touches on some of the key challenges for preparing the molecule data for deep learning, such as featurization.  For example,""Unfortunately, the behaviors of biophysical systems are critically constrained by their 3D structures, so the 2D techniques from previous chapters miss crucial information.  As a result, we will discuss a pair of new featurization techniques in this chapter.  The first featurization technique, the grid featurization, explicitly searches a 3D structure for the presence of critical physical interactions such as hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (more on these later), which are known to play an important role in determining protein structure.  The advantage of this technique is that we can rely upon a wealth of known facts about protein physics.  The weakness, of course, is that we are bound by known physics and lessen the chance that our algorithm will be able to detect new physics.""""The alernative featurization technique is the atomic featurization, which simply provides a processed representation of the 3D positions and identities of all atoms in the system.  This makes the challenge for the learning algorithm considerably harder, since it must learn to identify critical physical interactions, but it also makes it feasible for learning algorithms to detect new patterns of interesting behavior.""Similar to the paragraphs above, most of the book is pretty high level, with a few tips & tricks and code examples sprinkled in.  So this book is best for someone who would like a brief introduction (the whole book is a quick read, can be finished in one evening) before getting into other books and web resources that cover the topic in depth."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is long on talking about healthcare analytics which it should t need, vs what it promoted itself as an example for code that was healthcare based.I feel like many of chapters Are refreshers on basics vs in depth work on algorithms and founds on probability how much specifically applies to healthcare issues.I feel like of the 100 page book only about 5 to 10 pages are of value, not even that much value.I just dropped the review down another star as I was really looking for ward to a complex “made simple” analytics read about application of healthcare.Instead of the basics refresher course on course versus advanced healthcare.Which is the name of the book, “blah blah blah made simple” which is obvious to every industry, a very tiny portion is specific to only healthcare.This book should be republished 2nd edition as 10 page pamphlet on healthcare analytics, the rest could be found on a five to ten minute search of LinkedIn for paper saving sake."

It could also be a textbook to guide those in a more structured tutorial program.Overall the text is well written, easy to follow and insightful about the benefits and pitfalls about applying modern analytics to the healthcare environment.Burt Lesnick, MDPast Medical Director, The Children's Care Network (A pediatric accountable care organization in Atlanta, GA)Regent at Large, American College of Chest Physicians"
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This book covers a lot of important material in the field, but the title is very misleading: This is not an introduction. A good introduction tries to simplify matters for the newcomer, foregrounding the important aspects and concepts in an accessible way, thus minimizing the cognitive load. This book is much more concerned with exactness and having one over-arching model of the field even if it is in its abstractness not accessible to the newcomer. Very telling is a sentence like the following: ""The notation may seem awkward at first, but it generalizes to an impressive range of learning settings"" (p.15) (The notation is not only awkward, it is also highly unusual, as far as I know). From what I understand how didactic thinking in scientific and engineering disciplines developed in recent years, it moved away from the clean and often highly academic and idiosyncratic generalizations and outlines which have been so popular in the past and which are obviously the guiding model for this book.It is unclear to me, whom the author addresses with his book. Its main feature is an excessive reliance on mathematical notation which is often given as the only detailed description while the textual explanations are quite sparse. But from my experience not even the average computer science student will be comfortable enough with this notation to take it as a substitute for a more extensive verbal explanation. The same is certainly true for a student of computational linguistics.If you think of this book as a kind of handbook instead, which covers a wide range of important concepts in natural language processing using a very dense, but also very organized and clean way, it changes from a bad introduction to a very useful resource, which allows someone who already knows the subject and is mainly interested to see the main formulas to brush up on the details.It is a pity that the recent revolution of natural language processing, attention-based language models, has not found its way into the book; using these models in one way or another is nowadays the best approach for almost every nlp problem covered in the book."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"""Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective"" is truly ambitious in its scope.  A major selling point of this work is that it covers material, such as deep learning, that other large surveys leave out.  There are also some genuine insights in the book.  A new perspective is always welcome in this growing technical field, and Dr. Murphy appears to have a lot to offer here.However, the book suffers in its current form (my copy is the second printing) from the author's and publisher's hurry to get it in print.  (The author admits, on the site devoted to the book, that such a rush existed.)  The result is a book that, as other reviewers have noted, is less than perfectly organized and riddled with typographical and technical errors.The errata notes on the author's site suggest that the third printing will be much improved over the first and second (including, among other things, an essentially rewritten chapter).  My guess, though, is that it will take a good few years before the book's errors are altogether extirpated.  (Aside: Why is it nearly impossible to determine the current printing of a book before you're actually holding it in your hands?  This is pretty important if you're trying to get the cleanest copy possible.)This book has all the ingredients of a five-star ML text.  At the moment, though, it is hard to justify more than a three-star rating (especially given its hefty price).  I suspect that my ultimate rating will be a function of the book's printing number, its exact shape depending largely on the diligence of the publisher, the author, and his readership."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I admit that there are only very few machine learning books that have enough mathematics. And to make it worse, I found that even these very rare books occasionally cannot do the mathematics right. So I did not expect that this book would be perfect when I started reading this book. I also knew there would be many typos and all that, but I honestly do not mind that too much.Unfortunately this book still makes me feel really disappointed. I do not want to waste my time to tell people how bad this book is, but I want to be constructive in that I want to make this review helpful.Good: the subjects of this book are very broad in machine learning field. This is the reason that I bought this book.Bad: presentations of the contents. I really doubt that the author himself actually understands what he wrote in the book for some sections. The mathematics are way off in some parts. For example, the interpolating noise free data (page 114) and interpolating noisy data (page 125). And some basic simple mathematical facts are messed up over and over again. For example, quote ""One problem with the Gaussian distribution is that it is sensitive to outliers, since the log probability ONLY decays quadratically with distance from the center."" You know what the problem is here if you have some basic understanding of the mathematics and probabilities.Overall I give it three star mostly because the author did a decent job when he does understand what he is talking about."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are totally new to machine learning and looking to see how it actually works, step by step, this is not the book to get.  It is by no means a beginners book but more of an intermediate reference book.  Concept explanations are concise and written with an expectation of former knowledge.  No computer programs or pseudo-code for any algorithms are given, only snippets of code. And the organization of the book is fairly scattered, eg. the authors start talking about optimization methods before they ever get down to explaining basic learning algorithms (which they never really, fully explain anyway).If you are already familiar with machine learning, ""Python"", ""R"", etc., this may be a good reference book, but it falls very short for a beginners book.IMHOJerry K."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently had to quickly understand some facts about the probabilistic interpretation of pca. Naturally I picked up this book and it didn't disappoint. Bishop is absolutely clear, and an excellent writer as well.In my opinion, despite the recent publication of Kevin Murphy's very comprehensive ML book, Bishop is still a better read. This is mostly because of his incredible clarity, but the book has other virtues: best in class diagrams, judiciously chosen; a lot of material, very well organized; excellent stage setting (the first two chapters). Now, sometimes he's a bit cryptic, for example, the proof that various kinds of loss lead to conditional median or mode is left as an exercise (ex 1.27). Murphy actually discusses it in some detail. This is true in general: Murphy actually discusses many things that Bishop leaves to the reader. I thought chapters three and four could have been more detailed, but I really have no other complaints.Please note that in order to get an optimal amount out of reading this book you should already have a little background in linear algebra, probability, calculus, and preferably some statistics. The first time I approached it was without any background and I found it a bit unfriendly and difficult; this is no fault of the book, however. Still, you don't need that much, just the basics.Update: I should note that there are some puzzling omissions from this book. E.g. f-score & confusion matrices are not mentioned (see Murphy section 5.7.2) - it would have been very natural to mention these concepts in ch 1, along with decision theory. Nor is there much on clustering, except for K-means (see Murphy ch 25). Not a huge deal, it's easy to get these concepts from elsewhere. I recommend using Murphy as and when you need, to fill in gaps.One more update: I've been getting into Hastie et al's ESL recently, and I'm really impressed with it so far - I think the practitioner should probably get familiar with both ESL and PRML, as they have complementary strengths and weaknesses. ESL is not very Bayesian at all; PRML is relentlessly so. ESL does not use graphical models or latent variables as a unifying perspective; PRML does. ESL is better on frequentist model selection, including cross-validation (ch 7). I think PRML is better for graphical models, Bayesian methods, and latent variables (which correspond to chs 8-13) and ESL better on linear models and density based methods (and other stuff besides). Finally, ESL is way better on ""local"" models, like kernel regression & loess. Your mileage may vary...They are both excellent books. ESL seems a bit more mathematically dense than PRML, and is also better for people who are in industry as versus academia (I was in the latter but now in the former),"
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"In general, most of the topics  are not clearly explained, the chapters are not self-contained. In addition, most of the problems at the end of the chapters, consist in completing the steps between the book's equations, which I think is not very didactic, since it's just completing a bit of algebra. There are very few problems that really put you to think."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried loving this book but I think it would be best as an accompaniment to lectures or other textbooks. Simply put, It is not self-contained. It is not welcoming whatsoever to newcomers, even those with mathematical competency. The problems are challenging at different levels. I like the 3-star problems but some of the hints are confusing, in my opinion. I've made it through four chapters so far and I can say the people who probably benefit the most from this book are people who have previously learned the material or who perhaps use it on a regular basis.One strong point are the color figures. I will say, those are very helpful. But they don't quite make up for the terse prose and large conceptual jumps. I also find it strange that sometimes simply algebraic steps are explained while other much more complex ideas are glossed over. Anyway, 3 stars."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, I like the book and would recommend it. But the exposition could use significant polishing.Pros:- not mathematically heavy; lots of good heuristics that capture the math without delving too far in- choice of topics and their discussion (e.g. a great place to learn about kernel methods and graphical models)- easy to get hooked on if you mind the gapsCons:- read below...While the exposition is spotty (compare e.g. with Feller or Gelman), the author manages to follow a mostly linear exposition on fascinating topics.The book would highly benefit from editing provided by someone with a solid math background. In particular, there are more good mistakes than bad mistakes... Often when speaking with people with more stats background than me, the conversation is isomorphic to:Me: ""...therefore, this statement is wrong. I think what he meant was...""Bro: ""Ah yes. But you get it, that's what he meant""Me: ""Then why didn't he write it?""But at least dialogues like these help cement ideas...Please correct me if any of the following contentions are wrong (I may update as I continue to read):Some parts are not even wrong, for example:Sec 2.1, paragraph above Eq. 2.19""We see that this sequential approach to learning arises naturally when we adopt a Bayesian viewpoint. It is independent of the choice of prior and of the likelihood functions and depends only on the assumption of i.i.d data""First, if you follow the thread of this section and therefore go back to the contrived coin-flipping example, you would see that in the non-Bayesian point of view estimates are also updated in a sequence of experiments. Hence, a Bayesian point of view in this case is no more ""natural"" than a frequentist. Second, by definition of i.i.d., a single fixed distribution is postulated to exist, and therefore a prior is in fact chosen: how do you define a posterior without a prior? But ok, I think I get it: a sequential approach fits in nicely with the Bayesian point of view - I agree, and that's all that needs to be said.Mathematically wrong:Same section, following 2.3.5, the statement(s) following Eq. (2.20)""Note that in the limit of an infinitely large data set m, l -> infinity the result (2.20) reduces to the maximum likelihood (2.8).""First, if F is a function of x, then the resulting limit for x to infinity must not involve x. Plus, the order and/or direction of his m and l in the limit is ambiguous. Second, what he meant to say is that for m and l both sufficiently large compared with a and b, we get that (2.20) reduces to (2.8).3rd paragraph before 2.2:""For a finite data set, the posterior mean for mu always lies between the prior mean and the maximum likelihood estimate for mu corresponding to the relative frequencies of events given by (2.7).""Again we are told to forget that the choice of a prior makes a difference. It seems the above statement is false: we may choose a prior that is heavily weighted on a single point so that this prior's mean is greater than mle.Paragraphs directly above the beginning of 2.2:""In fact, we might wonder whether it is a general property of Bayesian learning that, as we observe more and more data, the uncertainty represented by the posterior distribution will steadily decrease..."" and then"" this result shows that, on average, the posterior variance of theta is smaller than the prior variance.""The ""result"", i.e. Eq (2.24) is an assertion of the form: ""Suppose a,b, c > 0, c is fixed, and c = a +b. Then, if b goes up, a must go down."" I don't see how this relates to what seemed to be his premise that increasing the size of a data set (sequentially or not) has the seemingly desired effect of reducing posterior variance. I suspect there are in fact limiting results in special cases that show the desired ""steady"" reduction in posterior variance...I wish he would have referenced themSection 2.3, following Eq. 2.44""... we note that the matrix \Sigma can be taken to be symmetric...""Actually, by definition any covariance matrix *is* symmetric.I could go on...All this said, it's worth repeating:I like the book, and not only because its mistakes or sometimes shady logic encourage the interested reader to try and discover correct/less wrong statements."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"While the book tries to explain things as best as it could, you certainly need a stable level of statistics and linear algebra. Not anything you can't understand if you've done second year undergrad linear algebra/stats (and here I am only with first year linalg and second year stats background). So certainly not something to be taken up if you want to start things quickI'm not sure about the exercises since I have never tried it yet. Though one thing lacking is probably the range of examples given by the book. While it tries to draw some things from intuition, with the lack of examples it can still get hard to understand some points in the book. At the same time some parts feels a bit too wordy.Overall still a satisfying book to have, especially if you use it as course material"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A very in-depth book on the topic. I used this book for my graduate level Machine Learning and Bayesian Methods courses. The book assumes solid math or other quantitative backgrounds from readers, as it jumps right into advanced calculus, linear algebra and optimization without much explanation. It pretty much expects you to derive the intermediate steps yourself or read the details from the original paper. I would only recommend it to people studying or doing research in theoretical machine learning."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't know why, but this book looks like author had set himself the target to play a charade with reader.The simplest methods spreads on the several pages of equations ( with not very clear described subscriptions, honestly saying). There is no attempt to clear things, so maybe it would be good for very-very-very thin layer of audience, who prefer this kind of stuff."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice book..
,5.0 out of 5 stars,What impressed me most is the clear and easy way it explains the different Data science and ML concepts and how it can be easily done in Python. It takes you from the basics and goes deep into advanced topics and covers a wide spectrum of topics. It also goes deep into specifics of each topic. It is also concise and not at all overwhelming. Manaranjan Pradhan and Prof. Dinesh Kumar have come out with an essential book .for any ML enthusiast
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Start with this book to understand the Machine Learning concepts in-depth and also be able to code them in Python. The book will help you build strong statistics foundation for better understanding the ML concepts instead of just rote learning. The book explains the concept very well, especially keeping the beginners in mind.The case-study based approach helps in understanding the application of the theoretical ML concepts taught. The approach in the book helps very much in the “learning and applying” cycle.PS: Do not forget to download the data and code from Wiley website 😊PPS: Retyping the code instead of copy pasting helps in learning better 😉"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The book covers all important topics in machine learning including advanced concepts such as regularization (ridge and LASSO regression) using real data sets.  Highly recommended for students and practitioners.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a person who was proficient in python and had played around with sklearn, this book helped me turn a hobby into a functional product with paying customers. Andreas is not only an expert in the field, and one of the core developers of sklearn, but he also has a great knack for explaining concepts in a simple and intuitive way. The reviews about the code examples is missing the forest for the trees. It's really the simple yet practical explanations of concepts such as implementing grid search, pipelines, cross validation, etc... that makes this book valuable. While some of this information is available via the online documentation, Andreas perspective on putting it all together is well worth the read.Highly recommend for anyone who wants to get into applied machine learning or is using sklearn."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Me parece un buen libro introductor al framework, sobre todo porque hasta el momento de esta reseña es de los únicos que tiene contenido actualizado a la versión 3.0 de Spark. Me ayudó mucho a pasar la certificación de Databricks en conjunto con el libro ""Spark: The Definitive Guide: Big Data Processing Made Simple"".Lo recomiendo."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Buen libro como complemento de “Spark The Definitive Guide”, que para no es la referencia principal. Este libro da una versión resumida del que acabo de comentar con unos cuantos ejercicios adicionales que pueden ser bastante útiles para la comprensión de la teoría."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommend this book for beginners looking to get into Spark programming. Examples are shown with both Python and Scala. I found the authors writing style extremely pleasant. Being a technical book the explanations were very easy to follow. Complicated technical terms are explained in very simple english.I have the kindle edition and noticed that the formulas on one of the pages on machine learning was slightly cutoff at the edges but I wont remove a star because of that. In my view there are tons of material online to understand those regression formulas. What really worked for me is how great a job the authors have done in explaining how to use Spark 3.0.Since I am a Python and SQL user this book really benefits me at work. The syntax and function explains are very clear and with an online Databricks account one can really practice as you learn with an uncomplicated dataset. How to program the Dataframe API is really well covered.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"aún no termino de leerlo, pero lo que llevo, es bueno, como no conozco nada del framework, es excelente para iniciar"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book to start learning Spark. Really easy to read and make sense of. Github repo is helpful. I would be even better to have more example code.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,good print
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It was easy to follow the book. The setup of Spark shell was also clearly written. I also find the instructions online to install spark locally to be sufficient as well. The book is well organized to delineate different components of Spark, e.g. intro, structured api, streaming, optimizations, data lake, ml deployment options. While ML deployment needs for individual business use cases are highly specific, I find the overview deployment framework provided by the book to be helpful. I also liked that the book uses screenshots of Spark UI and arrows to point in the screenshots to explain the UI, since the UI can be hard to understand. The code samples and the graphics in other sections are useful as well. There’s also coverage on how to connect to different apps, like beeline (which I’ve never heard of), tableau, thrift. Overall, the book contains solid information on the inner workings of Spark. I would recommend giving this book a read!"
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The rating is not for the content of the book. The content is excellent and Eben Upton is very good teacher (apart from a good designer of R-Pi).The book I bought cost me Rs 1700 + and written that it is printed / manufactured in USA. However it is fake. The prints (or xerox?) are uneven when you read from page to page and some cases it is so light print (or xerox?) that it is very difficult to read without pain in your eyes. So, my suggestion, do not buy print copy from India at this price (if it is Rs 500 then it is okey). You can buy the Kindle edition or print copy from International distributors."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,The book is much less than expected. The print is not clear. The paper is of low quality. And the content is a mess; looks like a copy from online guidelines. Not worth the money.
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"There are many little mistakes in the MATLAB code.And it is hard to distinguish the detail of Figs, because the Figs in the bookare printed black and white while the markers or linesare depicted color in the MATLAB code.In addition, most of Figs are blurred."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this book based on a quick skimming of the table of contents.  That was my fault for not looking in a little more detail.  The chapters sounded very much like what I was looking for, but the English is so broken and grammar so poor, that I find it very difficult to understand.  In some cases, you can get the meaning from the context, but this is too annoying and a waste of time."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The book shows clear steps to implement Deep learning algorithms with MATLAB. However, it doesn't have enough mathematical/theory to explain each algorithm in details."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It was a bit of a mixed bag. Opening chapter very much ""isn't the raspberry cool, aren't we cool""; not really what I expect from a technical book.The book has several authors, and it shows. They need a tougher editor. It read as if they hadn't compared notes. Repetition, assumptions that you knew stuff that hadn't been explained. As if a bunch of weblogs had been glued together.Nevertheless it was enertaining and educational.Not sure it taught me anything about computer architecture though."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this book as a beginner's guide to computer architecture. I don't have a Raspberry Pi so I skipped over the parts that related specifically to that. You definitely don't need one to enjoy the book.Overall, it's a solid introduction to the subject. The earlier chapters in particular are very well written: clear, accurate and friendly. Some later chapters are weaker - especially the one on GPUs (too advanced for this book) and the one on audio (light on detail and full of irrelevant content).If you're willing to skip over the less-good parts - and perhaps supplement your knowledge with other materials - this book is a decent and enjoyable primer, particularly to the core concepts of processors, memory and storage."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm shocked that there haven't been any other reviews for this yet - I can only assume it's because everyone who's bought it has been glued to the pages and far too engrossed to do anything else!Written by a who's who of authors, this book runs through everything you could ever want to know (and a lot that you didn't know you wanted to know) about your raspberry pi - from the chips on the board and the instructions that control them, to the software that runs on top of the hardware and opens up the wonderful architecture to experimentation!This book is far removed from a dry hard slog - yes, it's a technical book, however given the subject matter and the broad scope of the book, it could very well have gone down the academic route and been another dusty reference to dip in to for esoteric information. Luckily it carries with it (unsurprisingly, given one of the authors) the same ethos as the raspberry foundation - one that encourages exploration and learning, not just for learning's sake, but also for fun and experimentation.I love this book and recommend it highly to anyone wanting to know more about their little board - it's definitely a wonderful resource and gives a great grounding for those of us coming to computer science from other fields of study... and for those of us that like to see things that flash, make noise and cause us to stare in disbelief and absolute joy at when a project comes together.The book's only flaw is that the name of the man who has been bringing assembly language to the masses for nearly 30 years (Mr. Jeff Duntemann) has his name misspelled in places. However I think if you're the type to concentrate on problems rather than solutions, this book isn't for you, and neither is the raspberry pi.To summarise - Great Book. Buy It."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having worked in IT since the 1970s this book is a great walk through how the technology has evolved over the decades (yes - I remember paper tape and punched cards!) It also provides a great insight into how clever modern technology is and what actually happens when you use SD cards, Wifi etc. and how cache memory and multiple processors work together to speed things upA great review of the evolution of computer technology as well as providing an explanation of the current state of the technology. Relating it all back to what the Raspberry Pi delivers (at such low cost) really illustrates what great value current technology deliversI highly recommend this to students planning to study computer architecture and anyone curious to know how computers actually work"

Son niveau est tout à fait accessible, même pour les novices (toutefois, un petit niveau d'anglais est nécessaire !). Son auteur étant l'un des créateurs du Raspberry Pi, pas étonnant qu'il prêche pour sa paroisse, mais en fait, cet ordinateur n'est pas omniprésent et l'ouvrage pourrait être illustré par n'importe quel matériel équivalent (ou même aucun) sans qu'il y ait beaucoup de texte à changer.

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"According to the author, artificial intelligence (AI) has come to stay and it can only get better. This informative book features a variety of detailed sections, including:1) AI in Healthcare2) AI & Machine Learning Simplified3) Ethics of AI in Healthcare4) Implementation of AI into Clinical Practice5) AI in the Fight Against COVD-19 and Drug Discovery & Development6) AI in Electronic Health Records, Health Insurance, & Medical Education7) AI in Genomic & Precision Medicine & Virtual Assitance & Helpdesks8) Present State & Future of AI in Major Healthcare Specialities (as it applies to 31 specialties from Anesthesiology to Veterinary Medicine)9) A Review of Some of the Advances of Technologies & the Implications for Medical Applications10) The Role of Major Corporations in AI in Healthcare11) The Role of Start-Up Companies in AI in HealthcareAccording to the author, Doctor Parag Mahajan, in the healthcare sector, the use of AI presents many organizations with numerous exciting opportunities. It should be looked upon as a way to support medical institutitions rather than as a threat to human employment in healthcare.Doctor Mahajan predicts that AI in healthcare will especially develop:1) For the care and management of chronic diseases2) To increase the availability of health data of patients3) To better understand environmental and socio-economic facets of medicine4) To increase precision medicine & to integrate genetic information with care managementThis book is organized in such a way that the reader can find a particular section quite easily. Includes many real-life examples of artificial intelligence applied in modern medicine.I welcome a section to be added about how institutions of higher learning & university hospitals are giving instruction about artificial intelligence (as it applies to healthcare) to their current medical students. Perhaps highlight what cutting-edge teaching hospitals like Duke University Hospital and Johns Hopkins University Hospital are doing as it relates to AI in healthcare."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,He does a good job for beginners--great book. He also helps you see that machine learning and AI are not magic and in many cases not so useful. The book does help one get what machine learning (not really learning--just filtering) really is about.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this book because my daughter is looking at a career in Biomedical Engineering, and I have a software background. The text seems very thorough and provides extensive coverage on the topic. The claim that this book is “For everybody” isn’t quite accurate because the intro alone has a Gunning-Fog reading grade level of 19.5, which means it’s aimed at people who already have their master’s degree.Other than section two chapter one, it was immaculate. That 52 page chapter needed some work.It’s inappropriate to mock the 65 percent appeal rate using an AI without researching that the success rate without one in London is 31 percent. Science requires a control group for valid comparison.Chapter numbering should continue to increase across sections instead of resetting to one for each of the thirteen sections or having no chapter ID when there was only one in the section.You need real-world examples starting at Unsupervised Machine learning. The training-set image is pointless without a corresponding filtered result. You also need a concrete example in reinforced learning, regression analysis, etc. even if they come from economics (such as hyperplanes being used by car insurance companies to set premiums, denial conditions, and deductibles that maximize profit). LVQ was very muddy, and I have patents on supercomputer optimization. ANN has to have a real-world anchor like the traveling salesman problem for students to grasp it.Your term TPU is never defined."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Dr. Parag Mahajan delivers an exhaustive reference work detailing the role of AI/Machine Learning/Deep Learning in medicine. AI has been around  and in use for some time already. Having a medical background I was already aware of some of these uses and had not always looked upon AI favorably. However, as giant technological advancements have been made, it truly is awe-inspiring to contemplate what a valuable tool it really is in being able to improve our lives and those of whom we serve. This book opened my eyes to the positive strides that have been made and will continue to be made.I loved the breakdown of various medical disciplines in Section 8 (but if it had been in alphabetical order I would've liked it better). Also, as many have commented on, looking at AI in view of the current pandemic is a great way to get a look at AI in practical application in terms we can relate to.Another great discussion was Section 6, Chapter 4 - AI in Medical Education. Unfortunately it seems to be the way of things that education is often the last arena to be brought up to speed. I'm glad to see the issue addressed here. Section 10 is yet another captivating section centering on specific corporations and their efforts into medical AI.Although so much information could quickly become overwhelming, Dr. Mahajan delivers it in such an engaging manner that is understandable. Neither was I lost in the information, nor did I feel it patronizing. I found myself not wanting to put it down! Highly recommend this book!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not a doctor; I'm an artist. But Artificial Intelligence has come into the field of graphic design with a vengeance— Adobe, for instance, is constantly developing new features powered by the kind of iterative machine learning described here— and so this book caught my interest. It also helps that I have family members in the medical field (including one who is an engineer designing surgery robots).Whenever I read a non-fiction book I compare it to the excellent ""Lore of Running"" by Timothy Noakes, M.D., which is indeed a book about running— but it begins with a detailed discussion of energy transport in muscle cells and builds from there until it has covered every aspect of the topic: history, practical advice and a look toward the future.This book comes out very favorably in that comparison! Dr. Mahajan has covered the topic beginning with explanations of AI for laymen like me, carrying on through ethical concerns, mythbusting and finally a granular breakdown of the current and potential state of AI in every imaginable field from nutrition to veterinary medicine. As I see that this is the third edition, it's also good to know that the work is kept up to date. An ambitious effort, well carried out."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"One can’t deny what was put into this book. The author does his very best to stay objective, clearly stating upsides and pitfalls to the serious infiltration of AI in healthcare. There’s data and facts galore, so be prepared to soak all that in.I’ve worked in a hospital for nearly 20 years, having firsthand experience with the direction things appear to be going. I suppose this book will differ from person to person, depending on what occupation they have and their moral or ethical foundations.The book definitely makes you think, whether opening the floodgates of AI in medicine is good or bad for the human condition. I suppose it is advantageous—to a point, but what is the endgame to such a point? How far can and will it go? At what cost?I don’t think anyone human can accurately answer such questions…"

The possibilties are endless in every single field of medicine. AI doesn’t frighten me. I’ve seen first hand what human error can do in the medical field. Our cars are heading the same way with automated driving that can predict situations and react faster than a human being. The author presents comprehensive data as to how AI is being used and can be used in so many different areas of medicine. It’s biggest challenge may be the one he mentions early in the book - human connection and the fact that only 7% of our communication is verbal with the other 93% being visual/physical.A very in-depth book. I think many in the medical field will find it fascinating reading."

I had all sorts of notions as to what AI did and can do but I was surprised to find out the facts and how it has been implemented into our health system.The book is well written and formatted, the grammar is good and it is written in a style that is easy to understand and retain information.I liked that the book has been written in a way that really breaks down the subject and that the concepts are also presented in a way that informs and then educates around the subject. It's not written so that you are expected to have some knowledge of the subject first even though the subject is niche.AI is simply incredible and what is happening right now in health care with these new tools is astonishing. This is a fascinating book and an eye opening experince."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is an encyclopedia of artifical intelligence. Many parts of the book are only of interest, or of use, to particular audiences, for example, the math algorithm section could only be understood by math majors, and the discussion of medical specialty areas may only be of interest to those with that specialty.My main criticism of the book is that the reader , after reading the book, may wish to implement an AI system without understanding the associated problems. The author overemphasized solutions over problems. These problems include1. Big Data from medical records has problems which makes making medical decisions from it difficult.2. Not knowing how an AI system makes decisions may cause healthcare personnel to accept results when the input is flawed.3. AI used by a general audience may cause overtreatment.Point 1: Big Data from medical record has preliminary diagnoses, inconstent data, and may not have or properly recognize outcomes making medical decisions based on the data difficult. For more information, see the book, ""A Blueprint for Medicine.""Point 2 example: A machine I used at night to determine sleep apnea put a sensor on my chest. I accidently put my phone, playing music, on the sensor. Even told of this, the medical organization used the computer generated results anyway, as no one knew how to correct it.Point 3 example: Apple has a watch that looks for a Fibs. Can finding a single a Fib result in overtreatment by a physician, for example, overuse of a blood thinner?"

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"While this book does an excellent job of describing many aspects of Machine Learning, it doesn't live up to its title of showing you how to apply M.L. techniques to Penetration Testing.**HOWEVER** If this book was retitled: ""M.L. for Dummies"", I would give it 5 stars!!!  Note that I'm not mocking the author or potential reader - it really is an **excellent** introduction for newcomers to the M.L. field - exactly what the ""...for Dummies"" book series is intended to be!The vast majority of this book is spent describing concepts and algorithms for M.L., which I feel the author is very technically qualified to teach.  His writing style is very approachable, and he is very, very adept at relating these complicated topics to newcomers in the M.L. field.  In fact, I don't recall another source that can convey, in so few words, these deeply technical thoughts as easily as this book.The closest thing in this book describing M.L. ""for Pentesting"" is probably the 40 pages of chapters 8 and 9, which mostly name-drop various tools that can be used to investigate perturbing training data to influence an M.L. model's classification capabilities.  No mention is made in this section on how to use these tools and techniques for *Penetration* *Testing* - only for perturbing training data, which the author doesn't describe how to utilize for an actual Pentest-type of attack!Chapter 10 may be the most undersold chapter in this book.  It covers best practices for Feature Engineering - something that you *must* master in order to use M.L.  The lucid descriptions in this chapter, alone, almost justified my purchase price!Again, I think this is a great book written by a very competent author who has a gift for conveying very detailed technical matter in an easy-to-grasp way.  His writing style is very approachable, and this book is an easy read for the newcomer to M.L.In fact, if you are new to M.L., I recommend reading this book, first, to see if it is even something that you may want to partake of.But - again - this book is *not* a ""Machine Learning for Pentesting"" book.  It doesn't come close to hitting this mark, in my opinion."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a beginner I felt the pace of the book was very manageable and each concept is well explained with clear points, often backed up with visual illustrations. You get a good context on what is ML, the algorithms that power ML, and guidance on further learning careers. This book is not a substitute for a textbook but would be a nice complementary resource for anyone starting out in this subject. I feel that business folks or journalists who don’t have a lot of time to sit down and learn this advanced field and who need a rapid snapshot of ML would do well to read this book. As a title geared to ‘absolute beginners’, I would not recommend to more advanced stage learners to read this book. For me though it hit the spot. Would look forward to a second title in this series if there is one."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Considering that the audience for this book is very limited, the authors assume a fair amount of background information on the key scientific approaches/hypotheses that drive various stages of life science projects, particularly those on drug discovery.  Of course, not all stages, are amenable to or can rely on ML techniques, so one should expect some gaps in treatment in this book.  For a technical overview of the process and step-by-step exploration, the use of an example throughout the book is very helpful, though one may not be able to draw parallels to one's own project.  You will need to look at the sample projects at DeepChem dot io;  If your intent is to get an overview of ML techniques, there are much better books from the same publisher that you can depend on - this is not an intro to ML, this is an intro to a highly specialized set of topics."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll be upfront and admit that I don't work in the health sciences field. I grabbed this book because like many people in the data science field, I aim to be as well-rounded as possible.And much of the material was pretty decent. There was a lot of depth, with many examples (including sample code, which I wasn't always able to get to work), and instructions for finding sample data sets. I was able to understand the material without difficulty, and the examples were presented in a way that everything became obvious once you understood it. Overall, it was well-written.But as someone who doesn't work at a university, I don't normally use a Mac. I do use Linux, but on a Raspberry Pi, or off of a portable drive, mostly for my own personal tinkering, and so the heavy reliance on the Deep Chem library (which is not available for Windows) was a frequent source of frustration.Maybe you're exactly the target audience, and then I'm sure you'll be very happy with this book. But as someone a bit outside of that, there was quite a bit of annoyance."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"'Machine Learning for Dummies' takes a cross platform (Windows/Linux/Mac OSX) and cross language (R (RStudio)/Python (Anaconda)) approach. Both language tutorials are effective - if not comprehensive - for people already comfortable with basic coding.The basic math concepts behind Machine Learning: probability, statistics, matrix algebra and linear modeling are given concise, readable coverage - enough detail to apply to the immediate examples at hand. The math is not overwhelming - and I don't have an advanced math background (although I did take matrix algebra, statistics, and probability years ago).The first third of the book gets your environment set up and introduces you to the languages and some additional ML tools including SAS, SPSS, LIBSVM, Knime and RapidMiner. From then on the book really focuses on math/probability/modeling concepts as applied to ML. From there it's actual big data preprocessing, neural networks and algorithm coding.The writing style is what I call straight-ahead: serious, but clear and not overly academic or dry. This isn't one of those Dummies books that leverages a lot of humor.Bottom Line: 'Machine Learning for Dummies' isn't a high-level 'pop' book that's going to wow you with glossy demos of how well-known recommendation engines work. But for readers with a technical interest in the kind of algorithm-driven world we increasingly inhabit (online and off) it provides a substantial grounding in the data science/mining/engineering fundamentals of what goes on behind the curtain."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This introductory text on Machine Learning provides all the basics a budding Data Scientist or Onlooker from any Application Domain that could use Machine Learning Expertise needs to get started. I've read more than my share of White Papers from Software Companies and would be Consultants seeking to sell a prepackaged solution for Machine Learning and also struggled to understand academic papers with more mathematics and specialized vocabulary than I was able to follow; this book provides both the context for understanding what Machine Learning can do and the basic tools necessary to try Real World Algorithms and Datasets.  Yes, it does provide instruction for installing R-Studio and Anaconda Python in all the most common OS environments; but it also provides basic math background in Linear Algebra as well as Statistics, primers in basic programming in R and Python and a selection of the most common Machine Learning Algorithms and code for implemented examples of K-Nearest Neighbors, Classifiers, Neural Nets and Logistic Regression.No you won't learn everything you need to know to get a job as a Machine Learning expert or Data Scientist; but after reading this book and running several of the examples you would be ready to implement small examples with your own Datasets and then learn such application frameworks asTheano, Scikit-Learn, or TensorFlow.  The authors also have written an excellent guidebook: ""Python for Data Science for Dummies"".   Python for Data Science For Dummies (For Dummies (Computers))           This book is well worth having as an introduction to what Machine Learning can really do, and as an introduction to implementing Machine Learning Solutions to problems in your own Application Domain--Ira Laefsky, MS Engineering and MBA formerly on the Senior IT Consulting Staff of Arthur D.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not being an expert in machine learning but wanting to know more about the field, I appreciated this book. It seems to cover most important aspects of the topic, including picking parameters, constructing models and using different techniques like support vector machines, neural networks and random forest. It also does a good job emphasizing pitfalls like overfitting and fitting to sparse data and describes remedies for these problems. The book assumes no prior experience in coding or machine learning and tries to present a self-contained introduction to Python, but there is no doubt that having a bit of programming experience will allow you to implement the exercises much quicker and will enable you to access the machine learning meat of the book without spending too much time chewing on the bones and cartilage."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a book for beginners to the concept of machine learning. In fact, the book makes allowance for complete newcomers by providing the basics of installiunig and using Python and R. Interestingly, the examples throughout the book are for Python v2.7.11, not Python 3. The authors begin with a history of Artificial Intelligence and move on to how Machine Learning is distinguishable. It’s a slow moving book because the authors take pains to explain things in detail. The writing style is neither incendiary nor tedious.About half the book is devoted to getting started with a programming language before moving into the nitty gritty of Machine Learning.While this is a book for beginners in Machine Learning, it is not a casual book. The concepts are not necessarily easy to grasp and if you’re not into math, you’re going to encounter problems.Personally I found the chapter on image processing to be the most fascinating because it is a subject I am very interested in.Overall, it’s a good book for beginners in Machine Learning, though those who come to it thinking it’s easy will be disappointed.Jerry"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have a background in an applied science (like biology) and if you want a gentle introduction to modern methods for prediction/classification, this book is a fine place to start.  I teach statistical programming and analysis for a living so I got this book as a possible supplement for my students who walk into the class knowing nothing.  For that audience this book will help. It assumes that you know basically nothing about programming, and you know very little about advanced math (like matrix algebra).  What is here is good and it will help fill in some of the gaps for somebody who has big holes in their knowledge.  The coverage of R and Python is not at all deep but it will give the reader a feel  for how programming works.  The programming does not stress a few things that I think are critical (like the importance of vectorized functions in R) but all in all it strikes a good balance and teaches the very first steps for playing with data.  The coverage of machine learning algorithms are basically good and the writing sets the stage for people who want to learn more.  If you have some background in math/statistics/programming you will probably be better jumping directly to   An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics)           or   Applied Predictive Modeling           but if you are starting from zero grab this first before moving on to those books."

As a Junior in Undergrad, I bought this book expecting a introductory textbook to modern Machine Learning. However what I got was mathematically intensive proof of statistic models and every single variant of every probability equation ever thought derived. This book DOES NOT explain any concepts and certainly has little to do with practical machine learning. There are 10 pages dedicated to neural nets and 990 dedicated to probability. This is NOT an introductory Machine Learning textbook but a comprehensive review of probability and statistics. Linear Regression (step 1 of any Machine Learning course) is introduced 219 pages into the book! It also completely forgot to talk about Linear Algebra at all."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this book. It's cutting-edge and comprehensive as nothing else on the market and has the right mathematical level (for me, at any rate; I find this to be about right, and Hastie et al to be a bit hard). It makes a great desk reference for day-to-day work.Speaking of comprehensiveness, did you want to know about a symmetric version of KL divergence? It's there in 2.8.2. How about dynamic latent dirichlet allocation? See 27.4.2. Examples from cognitive science? See his refs to Tenenbaum and Xu's work. How about a reference to the fact that consistent preferences allow one to represent them as utilities? See 5.7.3.2. The discussion on utilities is brief, but I appreciate this sort of connection-making between disciplines (ML and micro-economics, in this case), even if cursory. Please note: I don't mean to suggest that his comprehensiveness is merely a question of making short references, rather that over and above all the deep & detailed material he presents he still finds the time/space to add these little cross-connections that, to me, make the book a lot more valuable.Minor complaints: I wonder why he didn't give much attention to newer neural network architectures (e.g. lstm). It also seems a bit weird that he seems to think of Bayesianism as the ""one true way"", and I say this as someone who loves the Bayesian philosophy. These are minor quibbles."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book on machine learning and Bayesian Statistics
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd think of this book as a reference book for the field of Machine Learning. It has a bit of everything in it but it doesn't have enough room to cover everything in depth, although it does do so for a few topics (Especially Gaussian Models in Chapter 4).  You'll need supplementary texts such as BRML (Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning; Barber) and Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms; MacKay), for example. Both of these books are freely distributed in electronic format by their authors.  Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop) is also a great book.  I also found some videos made by Varun Chandola for a ML course at the University of Buffalo on YouTube.  Since I'm new to the field, the videos really helped me through the first several chapters, which is all you need.  Once you understand the fundamentals, you can read the rest of the chapters without much of a problem.  It's still a big effort, though.All in all, it's a great book but you have to realize that if the author tried to cover every topic in depth it would be 5 times as big as it already is. So, naturally, some steps in the math are going to be cut out, left as an exercise to the reader, yadda-yadda. I think it's still a 5-star reference book, though."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is indeed written for beginners. The problem is that is it written very unclearly. In most cases you need to have a good idea of what the author is trying to describe in order to understand it. Try, for instance reading the section about logistic regression, and I am almost sure you won't understand it. The subject is actually simple and you will be better off just reading a Wikipedia article about it.In addition the are multiple typos that had to be caught by a corrector and some ridiculous cases when the author writes a formula, for instance 1/(1+e^(-x)) and spells is our in words ""one divided by the sum of one and exponent …."".Use this book only if you want to get a vocabulary of machine learning and try to get the actual info elsewhere.Disclaimer: I am an experienced software developer with an advanced degree in math"
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy it. Reads like a high-schooler's essay on some subject they superficially resesrched online. Very little real substance. Scary that this person is a (presumably) professional ML coder somewhere.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I want to say that this book is the perfect size at around ~150 pages if you exclude the exercises at the back. In my opinion, It's balanced with text and figures/graphics and provides a high level overview of concepts, models, algorithms, etc.The book itself is a fairly quick read and can be tackled in an afternoon if it keeps your interest. There are a wealth of additional resources the book provides in both footnotes and appendices. It doesn't waste it's time with understanding the fundamental mathematics and instead leverages the use of publicly available Python libraries. The math of Machine Learning can easily be intimidating and I commend the authors from shying away from it."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It a good overview book, however it would be good if difficult topics would be described without using domain specific terms, which assumes you already have ML knowlage.

I general it is good book, which I would recommmend reading as a starting point for its structured approach."

I was worried that I might get lost halfway through after the author started introducing the various algorithms. But no, this is where the book got significantly better. The visual examples and clear instructions made the rest of the book a breeze to follow. Although it was easy to follow, I don’t feel like I lost out on technical content. For a high-level introduction, it was concise and detailed.In terms of constructive feedback to the author, I offer the following suggestions: - Extend the chapter on ANN. I would have liked to have seen some full examples as with the previous algorithm chapters.- No mention of face recognition? This is an aspect of ML I think a lot of readers will be interested in discovering more. This I assume would slot into the chapter with ANN."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an excellent book which highlights current state of application of statistical learning techniques in quantitative asset management and also at multiple instances gives direction for future work in this area. I particularly liked the manner and detail in which many topics has been treated in this book.The book starts with chapter written by Michael Kollo, who lays down guiding principles for quantitative research in general, going beyond applications of machine learning. For a quant who is faced with dilemma of evaluating a range of existing models, the key takeaways would be not to fall in love with any one model and always ask “What have we learnt about the world here?” in evaluating a model.The chapter “Ensemble Learning Applied to Quant Equity” by Tony Guida and Guillaume Coqueret is very well and rigorously presented. The chapter gradually builds upon underlying methodology, data, empirical results, followed by discussion of the results. It does an excellent job in exposing readers (in a self contained manner) to ensemble learning techniques and its application to systematic equity investing, which is now becoming an actively researched technique in empirical asset pricing.The other chapters such as Natural Language Processing of Financial New by M. Berkan Sesen, Yazann Romahi and Victor Li; SVM-Based Global tactical Asset Allocation by Joel Guglietta, Deep Learning in Finance by Miquel N.

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I started determined to go through all the code samples in this book.The book starts with only four sentences about the Jupyter notebook although is the main environment for the whole book. The first code sample shown starts on line two of a cell, and it was very strange there was no line one. I was wondering if there was some type of misprinting.The code as printed is broken on page 10 where there is a line with 'display(data_pandas)'. This line gave me an error that display was unrecognized. I thought maybe this was a built-in Jupyter function so I went online to search. Eventually, I had to go to the author's GitHub and ask about this problem where I was told that he simply forgot to include 'from IPython.display import display'. It was a surprising admission because he did not say there was a misprint or mistake, but simply that he forgot to do that. It is very obvious there were zero technical reviewers for this book, because they would have also noticed the broken code right away.On page 11 we are introduced to a library called 'mglearn' which is a utility function that authors say they wrote for the book. Strangely, this repository has 733 stars on GitHub so it is obvious the library is not just for the book. Then in chapter two the author has tons of calls to mglearn which take in multiple parameters. The parameters are never explained and you have to go to the author's GitHub to see what the code actually does. In the 2nd chapter multiple of these mglearn calls broke for me. One seemed to be a conflict with numpy, and another I never figured out. I went to look at dicussions on mglearn to discover it is still a work in progress and there were sections where somebody was notifying the author that something was broken, and the author replying that he would look at it soon.The second chapter has 120 cell entries for supervised learning techniques. Each cell has roughly 5-10 lines of code, so there are nearly 1000 lines of code for the second chapter and they are all tossed into one gigantic Jupyter notebook. Explanations are very weak often defaulting to a brief description followed by code and then more code. Function calls and parameters are rarely explained at all.The last chapter is about natural language processing which is the machine learning subject I am most familiar with. Terms are often introduced with zero effort to define them, and it is assumed you already know many of the concepts. TF-IDF barely had any explanation at all, except to show the forumla for it. You can find much better explanations online.For a book which is so heavy on code and light on explanations, it is unacceptable that the code is broken."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is very basic, presented in an odd way, and in coding examples uses a library specifically designed for the book (author says it is a benefit to save a bunch of plotting related code - I personally disagree).  The book is theory heavy and light on code.  However, the theory presentation has a bunch to be desired.  For example, the book gives a very general overview of linear models, provides some basic code for training, testing and evaluating the models, but skips over the very important assumptions necessary when using a linear model.  The book is very weak (verus others I've seen) presenting tree-based models, SVMs, and neural networks - with what is presented I'm surprised they are included.  There is very little on preprossing (theory and code).  The unsupervised methods section is equally inconsistent.  There are discussion of using PCA for image processing and a section an text which isn't too bad.  However, overall, I think the information provided in the book is available with better presentation and more consistency elsewhere.  The pricepoint is high for what you get."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"A lot of symbols and a lot of pages but not a lot of insight in either the discussion or the problems.  We're in the 3rd plus edition and there are still basic errors about what constitutes a continuous function or what makes for a positive definite matrix.  Between errors and lack of insight, my sense is: the real issues is that the author has a shallow understanding of many of the topics in here.It's a mediocre book.  I debated between 2 and 3 stars."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This survey of ML topics is well written, well organized, and interesting to read. I particularly like his sidebar cross references to exercises that apply to the content discussed in the text there and to sections having related material elsewhere in the book. Bishop also puts some solutions to exercises online. Of the four or five ML texts now available (I mean real text books having a substantial amount of theory and requiring some knowledge of calculus and linear algebra), PRML is by far my favorite."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This graduate-level book is a very good reference for classic pattern recognition and machine learning methods. It might not be the best book for a first-time learner though since the author tends to jump-step a lot. This is understandable considering the amount of content and insightful discussions covered. For advanced learners, this book is one of the best. I really appreciate the mathematical discussions and derivations provided, which are essential for me to derive my own algorithms or models. I don't feel that it is lacking in examples at all. It actually has lots of good examples with great mathematical insights. (Again, this is from a researcher's perspective, not from a perspective of the end user of algorithms.) It also gives me solid mathematical backgrounds to understand state-of-the-art algorithms in research papers easily.This book tend to focus only on probabilistic, in particular, Bayesian methods (and does an excellent job doing that). Other important methods are mentioned very briefly or only discussed from the Bayesian perspective. I believe that each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses and this book does not do those approaches enough justices. Therefore, this book is not a comprehensive reference for pattern recognition and machine learning as it discusses these problems from mainly one perspective. But if your studies are in these areas, this is one of the top 5, must-have reference books."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have a solid math background and are interested in learning about machine learning, then this is the book for you. If you are coming from a CS or engineering background, you are probably better served with a more application centered book."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Usually considered to be a branch of artificial intelligence, especially at the present time, pattern recognition is defined in this book as the automatic discovery of regularities in data by the use of computer algorithms and the use of these regularities for classifying the data in different categories. The first part of this definition is typically referred to as `unsupervised learning' and the latter `supervised learning.' Both of these areas have resulted in a gargantuan amount of research due to their importance in areas such as medicine, genomics, network modeling, financial engineering, and voice recognition. This book emphasizes a ""conceptual"" approach to teaching pattern recognition, and therefore is highly valuable to those who need to learn the subject. Too often this field is taught purely from the formal standpoint, or conversely by the use of many trivial examples that illustrate the algorithms that are used. These approaches make the subject appear to be either a highly-developed mathematical one (which it is) or a cookbook that does not have a sound foundation. This book is one of the few that will allow the reader to gain a more in-depth understanding and appreciation of the subject as preparation for doing research and development in pattern recognition. The author claims that the book is self-contained as far as background in probability theory is concerned, but readers should still be prepared with this background in order to better appreciate the content. The Bayesian paradigm dominates the book, as it should given the current emphasis in research circles.Some of the highlights of the book include discussions on:* Relative entropy and mutual information. These two concepts have become very important in recent years, especially in the validation of pattern recognition models, the selection of relevant variables, and in independent component analysis.* Periodic variables and how they can be used in contexts where Gaussian distributions are problematic.* Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, especially the role of the detailed balance condition in obtaining the acceptance probability for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.* Bayesian linear regression and its ability to deal with the over-fitting problem in calculations of maximum likelihood and the determination of model complexity.* Kernel learning (usually called support vector machines in other books).Some of the minuses of the book include:* Needs more in-depth discussion of Bayesian neural networks, over and above what is done in the book. The author's does devote a section in the book to this topic, but given its enormous importance, especially in automated learning and economic forecasting, more examples need to be included.* More real-world test cases need to be included, along with a comparison of the efficacies of different approaches, so as to illustrate the ""no free lunch"" philosophy.* More exercises that require more analysis on part of the reader, instead of derivation-type problems or straightforward numerical exercises.* Needs more details on independent component analysis. Only a few paragraphs are devoted to this important topic."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent printing quality and very well structured contents. You will prefer it over ""the elements of statistical learning"" if you are not into the mathematical details of each theory."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Il s'agissait d'un cadeau et ce livre touche à un domaine très particulier où je ne comprends pas grand chose, donc je ne peux me prononcer sur le contenu mais la personne qui l'a reçu en cadeau était ravie."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The book as such is a great reference book for those interested in fundamentals of pattern recognition. The book is a classic text used worldwide, and should be a useful addition to the library.Only regret is that the book arrived in slightly torn condition, only the covers. Overall, still manageable, not torn enough to request a return, but the delivery could have been slightly more careful as it's a bulky book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really recommend this book to anyone who is trying to understand the theoretical details of classical machine learning. Most of the equations have derivations/can be easily derived based on derivations nearby. Also has an online solution manual to some of the practice problems. Great for self-learners.

,4.0 out of 5 stars,Just received the book today. The appearance looks nice but some pages are stick together. One page has a hole.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you want to get started in computer science start with this book.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been working in software development for nearly 25 years, having studied engineering at University. My background as an engineer has always left me at a slight disadvantage when talking with colleagues who studied computing, as they seem to have an understanding of all sorts of areas of how a computer actually works that I've never been taught. (I've mostly managed to get by without knowing about them, but I've always felt a bit of a bluffer as a result!)This book, therefore, is an utter godsend to someone like me. It explains, in clear layman's terms, all about the details of how a computer actually works - how the processor works, how memory is accessed, how caching works etc. Even peripheral details - networking, storage media, 3D graphics - all are covered in enough detail to enable a layman (or even an engineer) to gain a good understanding of them. In simple terms, if you read this book, you will know how a computer works.The style is very good - clear and readable, with plenty of diagrams. The only small caution I would give is that the cover and title are slightly misleading - this is not a book about the Raspberry Pi; indeed the Pi is really only relevant to a couple of chapters, but the Pi is a hot topic in computing now, and the inventor of the Pi is one of the authors, so I think that can be forgiven!In terms of audience, this is a serious textbook - I'd say it is aimed at A-level to first-year undergraduate students rather than younger children - but it is nonetheless very approachably written.As the title says, I wish I'd read this at the start of my career rather than half-way through it, but I'm making up for it now. If you have any interest in working in software or computing, this book is a must; I cannot recommend it highly enough."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"You really need to know what this book is, and what it isn't.It's not a beginner's manual for the Pi.It's not, in any shape or form, a book of projects for the Pi.It's (arguably) not a book for complete beginners to the subject of Computer Architecture.It's not (even more arguably, I suppose) even REALLY a book about the Pi at all.This is a meaty, detailed look at how the innards of your computer (any computer) work, and a history of how they reached their current state.  While it makes occasional references to the Pi, after the first few chapters these are almost incidental.Personally, I'd say it's pitched ideally at people who know a BIT about how computers work, who are interested in deepening that knowledge and learning some computing history along the way.  It's perfect for this audience, and no, you don't need to have a Pi to read and profit from it."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Although this book goes into detail about how the components of the Raspberry Pi work and interact with each other, computer architecture uses similar components so you also get an understanding how computers work.This is a well written and detailed book. You can tell that the authors know in detail the Raspberry Pi, in fact one of the authors is a co-creator of the Raspberry Pi.Not only does the book give a simple explanation, but it also goes into great detail and includes diagrams and drawings to help explain the processes.This is a book that you can pick up anytime and start reading anywhere. I can remember the old ZX81, ZX Spectrum, Amiga and C64 days and this book bought some of those memories of many hours programming the Spectrum. I did not know how the components interacted, but can still remember the PEEK and POKE commands.If you are interested in the Raspberry Pi or on how computers work, this is a great starting point.I enjoyed reading it even though some of the topics went way over my head."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want to learn from someone significant in the industry, then Eben Upton is going to be the figure for telling you about the Raspberry Pi. So, it's off to a great start. This aims to be more than just a completely dry discussion, this outlines a little of how Upton got into the field and what was trying to be achieved with the Pi, and some of the things that can be useful. In terms of the principles of computing, with programs as data, details about the structure of a modern computer, etc, this is reasonably complex and detailed - and certainly at least on a par with the kinds of books that BCS recommends for learning about the structure of computers for their Certificate in IT modules, if not more detailed in some areas (although BCS prefers more discussion about Machine Code). Definitely this puts it at Undergraduate level detail and complexity.If you're wanting to lean a bit about why computers are structured as they are, something about what came before (with the trials of fixed wiring, pre-digital memory, punched tape, etc - all a bit before my time as I started in the magnetic tape era), and then move onto a discussion about how a computer works and specifics about the Raspberry Pi and what you can do it it and how its physically different to larger computers, then this is an interesting, well-written book.If you're only interested in learning how to use a computer and don't want or need the full details, or if you just want to learn to do a bit of scripting on the Pi, then you don't really need this, but if you genuinely want to learn more about Computer Architecture in general and the Raspberry Pi's design decisions in particular, then this is the book - coming from Upton for the Pi at least it's the definitive reference."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this book years ago, but life got in the way and didn't use it, but recently found my son tinkering with the Pi I bought, with the help of this book. He's found it to be really intuitive and quick to reference, I was really pleased considering he normally uses Youtube for anything instructional, but he needed to go deeper on this and found this book the ideal aid"
,3.0 out of 5 stars,It is an interesting book about a good topic but one that I am very ignorant of.I hoped I could absorb knowledge reading this book but to be honest I am not able to do so.It is an entertaining book and I am sure it is very informative but at my level of knowledge it flew straight over my head.It does have a lot to impart on the inner workings of computers and how they have been developed. Just not really right for someone who is advanced in years and zero computing knowledge.If you are into computing and want to broaden and build on what you know then this is a good one to buy.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very good book for learning how computers work.  It explains things very clearly.The title is a bit misleading - it is not a book on the Raspberry Pi.  It does not say that it is but people might get the impression it is.(I uploaded 10 photos.  Sometimes Amazon does not publish all photos, and may publish them in the wrong order.  If that happens, please bear with me - I will try to resolve it).I have photographed the Contents pages so you can see what it covers (photos 2-7).  I have also photographed a few pages from the book to get an idea of what it is like - on decimal, binary and hexadecimal  (photos 8-10) .I must tell you that it is a black & white book, though for what it covers it does not really need colour.  Colour would be good but it increases the cost - I imagine that the writers preferred to keep the cost, and therefore the sale price, down.I found it very informative.Price at time of review: £15.69."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,The core ideas and functions well explained. A book to read first and then digging into specialization. Helps to grasp the essentials and to have a base for the next level
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is short but I think that's it's strong suit.  I suspect it's usefulness will wear off as this information becomes more foundational knowledge through my research into ML but as a beginner in the field, I find that having an easy to navigate reference book for the algorithms I need to learn to become an ML expert is very useful."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,The author did a very good job in explaining machine learning principles and tools. This is not the book for you if you are looking for more than the basics or high level overview.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been curious about this subject for a while and recently started to do some research.  This book provided a nice high-level understanding of the topic and it's related subject matter.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an AI enthusiast, I like that this manuscript provides the breadth of knowledge around the emerging field of automated machine learning.  The coverage of multiple clouds in particular helps the reader to understand the state of the eco-system, along with its open source components.  We quickly see AI platforms adopting AutoML, and it is timely that practitioners learn about this technology.  Highly recommended."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,explained important concepts in a lucid manner with the right combination of theory and proofs. necessary first book for grasping concepts of ML
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Attention to those who might pick up this book without having a strong background in data science or mathematics--large chunks of this book will probably be a slow slog for you, as it was for me.I am very surprised this book is rated so highly.  There are so many concepts/things thrown out there as if they were common knowledge, when they're not. By the point the book starts diving into coding basics around Chapter 13, I realized I needed to find another, better book. I've found free online resources and an online course that have made Python much more digestible."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I found this book to be a great resource for reference, although I'm not sure it's for people completely lacking statistical or machine learning knowledge.  The author references ML terms quite early on without really explaining what they are.However, in my case, I was using this book to jog my memory of concepts I'd learned but forgotten in college.  I majored in stats, with a focus in ML, then spent 2 years doing front end development.  Now I'm going back to machine learning, and this book is the perfect, short and sweet summary of the terms and concepts needed to understand everything at a high level.It's a great reference to have on your bookshelf - especially to remind yourself quickly or a term, or if you're trying to compare and decide on what algorithm you need to use for a new dataset."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,New to ML but have done programming in previous jobs. Found this book extremely helpful. Gives a great introduction while instigating your curiosity to explore and learn more. Love it. Would request the author to write a sequel.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book was written in plain English and really meant for people without a lot of Math background to understand. Unlike other books such as ""the 100 page ML book"" which is full of math, this book explains the concepts very well, without using a whole lot of math. This book is NOT for those who are serious about digging into data science or machine learning. But it's good for everyone else who wants to get a high level overview of what ML/Data science is about."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Judging this book by the cover, I had expected a good read. Upon seeing the book and flipping through, I felt a little letdown because I could see that it was written in MS Word, Arial font, and had a few irritating things left at default settings. Once I got into the subject matter, I easily looked past formatting issues and really enjoyed the material. Very interesting work and a great place for someone like me who has little to no clue what machine learning is to start."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would like to tell everybody, this two books are really great for who really want to jump in machine learning field. Lots of real world scenario, prefect example is one of the best features of these books.I really enjoy and learn lots of basic things to start my career in Machine Learning."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,Just received this book today and saw that there were missing text that make it look like a blank column on the even number pages for all paragraphs from page 2 to page 76.I'm sure this is an Amazon printing issue.This rating is not on the content of the book. I will rate it once I receive a readable replacement.....UPDATE....Recieved replacement book one day early. All of the printing looks great and returning the miss printed book through UPS was seamless. Thanks.

,4.0 out of 5 stars,cover is a slightly worn
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best books on probabilistic approaches to machine learning.  I like that the author not only describes various techniques but also takes the time to try to pull out the intuitions behind concepts, compares techniques to help the reader understand what makes a technique special and provides a detailed bibliography so that details can be followed up in the original literature.  The book covers a huge swath of material from basic theory of Bayesian reasoning all the way to recent work in deep learning models. I find I learn something new every time I pick it up.  The first edition had a lot of errors, but there are published errata and I understand that later editions have been fixed."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In my mind, this is the new definitive textbook for anyone in Machine Learning.  It covers a very broad range of topics very well; presenting them clearly but not avoiding necessary details.  While it is not a complete replacement for any specific area or technique, it provides a general background that allows someone within the field who does not specialize in an area to gain a solid understanding of the fundamentals."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is well illustrated and easy to follow. The author does a great job of simplifying the concept so a toddler can understand.  I recommend this book if you wish to expose your kids to the top technology of today and the future.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a great way to introduce kids to technology!
,2.0 out of 5 stars,I hate the way the author represents equations and algorithms in this book. I feel like he just looked at other info and re-packaged it in a way to look novel. Just preview it and you'll understand. Then get on Wikipedia and actually see something you can interpret.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Being a practitioner of math algorithms, I use it as a comprehensive theoretical reference. By far has been the most useful book in my ML collection. One still often needs to dig deeper thru the references to implement an industry strong algorithm, but this is a good initial kick into the methodology area to be used."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book for those who are not from the statistics field and want to learn machine learning using a probabilistic approach.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It is an excellent book, ideal for my work and, I imagine, for many others in need of advancement into machine learning from the various fields of statistics.  The only thing is, there is an equation I believe is incorrect, and it turns out to be one I really need to understand.  I have the fifth printing, and it is on page 118, section 4.3.3, equation number (4.91).  I have written to the suggested email for Kevin Murphy a couple of times, asking if the equation says what it means, or if it might be some kind of error.  Have not heard back, but perhaps I will soon.  This is a great book, which may surprise people who are not ""just at"" the level of training needed to follow the development.  But the target audience is, I think quite large and in need of his guidance."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Background: I am first year master student in Computer Science at Santa Clara University.I am sure this textbook is very readable if you know the math notations, which you can refer them in the reference. The book has all you need to master the most beautiful part of Machine Learning.Try to study this, this book will help you to do a machine learning research and publish articles in academic journals."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great ML reference.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very thorough, useful and practical introduction to genetic algorithms. Found it better than almost all similar books. It shows a good way to use deap libraries as well."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow this is an awesome GA book which use DEAP to demonstrate how to solve easily various type of problems using GA. This is the best book ever in GA.It comes with complete codes which can used in my projects.  I learnt a lot. Thank you!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,仕事関係で購入して独学しています（QSAR分野でfeature selectionなど案外行けそうな感じがするので）。数学の内容を数式など使わずに平易な言語表現で語っており非常にやさしい本です。英語が問題なければ普通に一日1 chapter進められる。完読したら実務的にGAが使えると考えられます。追記：niching & sharingの解説と実装はこの本の肝要と思います。勉強になりました。必要な事前スキル・Pythonの基本作法・最低限の数学知識（高校生ないし学部教養レベル）・Machine learningの概念（ほんとうに概念だけ）
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Starts with an overview of genetic algorithms (GA) then introduces the DEAP framework for evolutionary computation, which is used in the book for the various example problems/solutions. All of the code is explained and as you read about the examples and inspect the code, you can get ideas for possible applications of GA to real problems. Very gentle learning curve, but you should know some basic Python before starting this book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted break into GA and apply it to real-world applications as quickly as possible. This book is the very book I was looking for. It breaks down and explains complicated concepts clearly and concisely. The sample code is easy to follow and understand. There are no difficult maths or even challenging sentences. Unlike many other books on the field, it doesn't try to pile up words with windy content. This book is concise, straightforward, and well written. From an engineer's eyes, it delivered the information in the most efficient way. Also to my pleasant surprise, this book covers related topics like PSO and ALift that I didn't expect. It doesn't talk about these topics extensively but gives me critical pointers for further learning.This book is ideal for someone who is:- new to GA.- already experienced with Python.- constrained by time.- looking for a broad coverage on this topic.It's not a good fit for someone who is:- unfamiliar with Python.- looking for theories or rigorous maths.- looking for in-depth knowledge (although this book links to in-depths materials)."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had no experience in this topic and it took me sometime to find a problem in my field I could apply this to but once I tried it was really good to use this book as a learning platform. Definitely recommended
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The book doesn't get to even the first snippet of code until the third chapter. It starts with a pretty thorough introduction to Genetic Algorithms that covers the whole first section. I would expect a ""hands-on"" book to introduce these topics along side code samples. What samples the book does include are often one or two lines out of context without much explanation for how to use them. The Kindle formatting is also off so each numbered entry in a list of paragraphs is indented. This leads to  pages that look like the attached photo that make reading the book more of a chore than a pleasure."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was the best Genetic Algorithm book ever in my life. Due to its simplicity and pesudo-code-like nature of the Python language, the example codes does not interfere with the readers’ intellectual engagement into the beauty of evolutionary algorithms."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The code examples were easy to follow. The author did a nice job of explaining a complex concept in understandable terms. I really enjoyed the book. It helped me gain a better understanding of the use of genetic algorithms.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good book on GANs.Familiarity with tensorflow and keras essential. Working knowledge of python is mandatory.Codes are downloadable.Takes time to understand the details, as the theory is not discussed in detail.I just saw the new price. Rs. 3,500+. The book is really not worth this price. There are many substitutes."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I found this to be one of the only books on Generate deep learning. The first two chapters are very well explained, however from chapter 3 on, the book fails. The explanation; only theoretical, is good with simple analogies, but the book in no way educates the reader on how to actually code their way through. The packages that have been imported etc. Only code snippets are presented and the explanation is redenered not so complete when you can't complete the rest of the chapter without writing your code. p.s. the prerequisites for the book is only python with basic linear algebra but you would only be able to get through the the book if your referring for the real content of the book from François Chollets' Deep learning with Keras and Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition. Kind of disappointed"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"before having this book, I was an absolute beginner in generative deep learning. Now, I at least have understood some concepts along with code. not giving 5 stars because this is a black and white print, many concepts mentioned here refer to coloured diagrams, but the diagrams are black and white."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome book !!  The author has very good writing skills. He has explained complex theories by pictorial & diagrammatic way which makes things really cool. Specially GAN, Text generation parts were very good. Some mathematical theories were also well covered."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Book is in the way that it needs some basic introductory knowledge about Machine learning and Deep learning. Even though the book explains it from the beginning, a slight knowledge of ML is good for moving forward.."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have read multiple books on advanced topics of Neural networks like GANs, but no other book comes close to how well the author has explained the concepts. The individual topics covered is very complex but author has done an incredible job of simplifying things and making us understand the core principles in an intuitive way."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Author has beautifully crafted engaging stories behind the intuition of various generative models which are typically dry to read. Completed the book in a day like a story book !  -Each block of code snippets are nicely explained.  -Typos are present here and there. But I hope it will be corrected in the next edition.Hope to see many books like this in the future.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good introductory text to generative models and it is easy to read. The author likes to use lead-in story but some of them are too long-winded and I often had to skim several pages quickly to get to the technical stuff.I was particularly interested in learning GANs to create images but disappointed to find that it uses only simple models with toy datasets. For example, there are many freely available online tutorials on DCGAN and CycleGAN; much of the code in the book were also taken from open-sourced Github repo.Therefore, I went to buy a couple more books and found ""Image Generation with TensorFlow"" to be the best for my need as it covers not only the basics but also state-of-the-art models like StyleGAN and image transformer."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very entertaining reading. Print quality could be better, but that's on Amazon, not on the author I guess..."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is really a good overview of use-cases, has code samples, some overview of the maths and is reasonably up-to-date. I had some knowledge of GANs prior to reading this book but was missing knowledge on actual implementation to get going, this book filled that gap very well and gave a bunch of terms, definitions and references so I could get going and continue on my own after. Top marks."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The first half the book is stuff anyone with experience doing any serious sort of data analysis should already know. This also includes several  chapters on installing R and Python. If the reader needs all those chapters devoted to installing R and Python and the necessary, then there is almost no chance that that same reader will get anything out of this book. The second half of the book appears to cram many different statistical concepts into a few chapters and hope something sticks."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good book and covers a lot of the current topics. The best part of this book is that the author positions each topic very cleverly and if one follows the book with a bit perseverance and works out the maths given in the equations, the relation between the topics become vivid. I do think it will be good to go through the book in a leisurely pace instead of skipping any topic."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a kindle version excited to read the book. I downloaded the book in my kindle and I got information that I cannot read in my kindle. I tried the cloud read.amazon.com and got the info as Kindle Cloud Reader cannot open this book. Surprisingly, I was able to open it in my android phone. I really don't understand why it is not working neither in my Kindle or Cloud reader. Why is amazon selling a book which cannot be read in its device and Cloud Reader?"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Probably the best available book if you are looking for the theoretical understanding of ML. Don't expect programming examples. Works best when coupled with some lecture series and outside code. Heavy on content.

The paper is matte(as it should be) and not glossy as mentioned in previous reviews, which is perfect for reading (Got the 4th Indian Reprint edition : November 2021).No complaints on the book, but a complimentary bookmark would have made it better."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm currently on a course learning Machine Learning and family and this book was recommended (well earlier revision), but it explains things well with good examples.I ordered on Kindle as much prefer reading that wayRecommended if new to ML/DL/NN etc"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! This is a very specialised book indeed. If you are a wannabe programmer/coder than this book may be out of your league (unless you aim to be in the top team). If you only want to be able to program and run a Raspberry Pi there are better suited books for this specific purpose. However, if you really want to understand the very fine detail as to how computers really work, and the Pi in particular this is the very best book I have seen on the subject for many years (IMHO). Fantastic detail and good explanation. Therefore best suited for trainee uber geeks or those who can spare the time and effort to learn. Wannabe programmers/coders  who do put in the time to read and understand this book will have a huge head start on those who do not. Everything is included especially the kitchen sink."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Way back when the first IBM PCs became available I had an excellent book called ""Inside the IBM PC"" by Peter Norton, in many ways this book is an update of that. It explains the constituent parts and software of a microcomputer in a comprehensive, down to earth way.  It is just packed full of useful information on how things work, essential to know when things don't. I found the chapter on WiFi really useful as it comprehensibly covered some of the problem areas; my house is built with foil-backed plasterboard, common in the 1970s, and is a nightmare for wireless and we have to use repeaters. Overall an essential book for anyone interested in microcomputers, not just the Raspberry Pi."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,OK
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really nicely put together covering virtually everything you might want to know about the history leading up to the Raspberry Pi. The book is clean, clear and no-nonsense in it's approach. Great style and easy to read. I have to say that the font is really clear too although it's small, it's still easy to read (which is very unusual). This is a really great book - I love it!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! AAA+++"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are very few aspects of computers generally that are not covered by this book. Although it is aimed at the Raspberry Pi computer, it can help anybody involved with computing to get a handle on pretty much all aspects of computing.  The book has 480 pages of content plus 26 pages just indexing the content. I have been working in the computer industry over 30 years, and I studied computing at University, this book is teaching me new stuff, and explaining stuff in a clear straight forward way. The six authors have an extremely wide range of experience in the field of computing generally, and the Raspberry Pi specifically. It is hard to review this book without going into extreme generalisations, but you REALLY, REALLY have to get this if you have any interest in computing at all. It is a joy to read.As other reviews have said, I wish I had this book when I started out on my computing journey. If you are looking to get a book for someone for Christmas, get this for them, you can't go wrong, otherwise, get this book for yourself!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book was clearly written by authors who wished to convey their love of the details of how computers work from software down to the hardware level.  It was obviously not written for profit, but to support the education goals of the Raspberry Pi Foundation.Ever since my first involvement with programming machine language on an IBM 1620 in 1962, I have been fascinated with the interface between software and computer hardware.  Each chapter starts out gently with a historical narrative about how that chapter's topic evolved from the early days of computing and proceeds right up to the very sophisticated techniques used in modern computers.  It provides the details of processor pipelining, memory caching strategies, graphic acceleration, video compression, how Ethernet and wifi networking challenges are resolved,  methods of digital storage, and much more.  All this explained with great care providing an emphasis on details that are often ignored in other computer books.  The only thing missing was a discussion of the Bluetooth interface of the Raspberry Pi 3.There were times when I failed to understand a sentence only to re-read it and find that in my haste I overlooked or misread a key word.  Every word, sentence, and paragraph is important.  Computer architecture has numerous acronyms and with very few exceptions, each is introduced properly and referenced in the book's detailed index.  This book has been proof-read with extreme care and its content written with true expert knowledge.  It is a masterpiece with 500 carefully-written pages, numerous enlightening diagrams, and costing only about $20."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a software engineer at one of the big tech companies, so I'm not a complete beginner but I've still learned a huge amount from this book (and I've only got as far as the chapter operating systems).  It's a bit of an odd book in that it spends some time explaining binary (which is essential to understand for the rest of the book), but it seems hard to believe that anyone not already knowing how binary numbers work would want to go deep into exactly how magnetic signals are stored on a hard drive (several chapters later).  Still, there's plenty in here I didn't know already so I shouldn't make assumptions I suppose.  If you work with or are interested in computers and want to really understand how they work down to the physics then this is a good book for you."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish I could give it 4.8 stars. This is a great book. Too many computer architecture books are unapproachable (half the book is mathematical notation). This book is nothing like that. It explains things very simply and is very approachable. My only complaint is that they sometimes use acronyms without explicitly defining them and perhaps assume you'll infer the meaning from the context (an example is ""LPDDR2"", the ""LP"" is nowhere defined - I assume from context it stands for ""Low Power"" but that was never clarified in the book, the acronym is simply introduced with no definition). Even so, I highly recommend this book for the motivated reader - just know you'll have to Google some things on occasion."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book has very thorough explanation for anyone who wants to learn computer architecture beyond the basics. The author gets into many details of how a machine works from hardware to software. It doesn't get too deep into some details which you will learn in the computer architecture and engineering textbooks, but gives you some intro into how things work and provide direction on where to look for further study."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent overview of state of the art computing including instruction sets, buses, memory architecture, compiler technology and so on.  The Raspberry Pi is described in some detail but other architectures are mentioned as well.  The authors have also included historical notes which help the reader understand just how we got where we are.Experience programming and interfacing microcontrollers is helpful but not required.  The material is authoritative without being overly formal.  Anyone interested in understanding modern micro technology will find this a worthwhile read."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I think this is a great text considering the vast array of topics covered by Bishop in this book. The best thing I liked about the book are the fantastic insights the author has provided on various methods and their usage limitations, sometimes in very easy to understand language and studded with some real practical experience going behind it. One thing which I found rather missing was the excessive use of equations without much dwell into their derivations, which can sometimes confuse the first time reader, but when worked diligently by hand, would make the stuff clearer. Said that, the book is a great text for someone to gain latest perspectives on the field from the author's rich research experience. I would definitely recommend someone who wants a fairly broad and usable knowledge about this field."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was surprised to see that this book received only four stars, seeing as how useful this book is to me on a day-to-day basis, yet after some thought I think I agree. There are some fantastic chapters in this book. Chapter 3 on linear regression and its Bayesian variants in particular is beautiful and deep. Other chapters falter, like chapter 8 on Bayesian networks which is maddening. The book has an emphasis on deriving formulas as opposed to showing practical examples; those looking for more practical matters should read   The Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie           instead. I find the book is very useful as a reference when elaborating non-standard machine learning methods. The appendices on probability distributions and matrix properties are indispensable, in particular. Some widely used methods are glossed over (boosting for example), while others, like the relevance vector machine, are described in detail despite not being well-represented in the literature. That being said, the breadth of methods presented in the book is much greater than in other similar books, and I frequently reread it when I get stumped on a machine learning problem."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is quite good in the material it covers. However, other aspects, for example, decision trees, are only briefly covered. I think this is because this book provides a NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems conference) view of the world, where only certain aspects of the Machine Learning world are accepted.This book, together with Duda, Hart, and Stork's book   Pattern Classification (2nd Edition)           make an excellent pair."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I often feel that machine learning books are either too high-level and do not have any benefit for someone with some fundamental understanding of the topic, or they are so technical / mathematical that you would need to be an expert on the topic. The author strikes a very good balance, providing more technical background for readers with a basic grasp of the subject, and offering potentially new perspectives for readers with a higher level of technical expertise. As a plus, the author’s tongue-in-cheek style of writing makes it an enjoyable read."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,I will need a second pass on the book but I think it gave a great introduction to the world of machine learning. Not boring at all!
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointing book. It’s almost unreadable at times because the author tries to explain the most basic concepts - it’s as if he’s written it for people who haven’t visited planet earth before, let alone those who haven’t visited machine learning. Digression after digression - like Tolkien, but less fun - he seems to take the longest route possible to explain a concept. Succinct and clear it isn’t.It isn’t a long book, and consider these digressions, it feels too lightweight. The author tries to marry all of the terminologies and ideas from various fields - like statistics, mathematics, probability etc - but in doing so, it reads like a dictionary of terms at times, losing the overall flow of the idea.If the author had treated the reader with a bit more intelligence, we may have had a better read. It’s a shame because I have quite a few of the “MIT Essential Knowledge” books, this is the poorest I’ve read. As other reviewers have noted, it feels rushed, and the writing style is yawn-worthy.Hey, I know, this is machine learning, it’s hardly going to win any literary prizes, but I’d recommend looking elsewhere for a primer on the subject."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are looking for a brief overview of what Machine Learning is all about and a beginners level explanation of a number of the most common algorithms used, then this book is for you; it assisted in me getting a basic understanding of the subject, before I started a Machine Learning module. This book just introduces the discipline, it is not aimed at ML practitioners.A good introduction to a complicated, but essential, subject."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I would highly recommend this book if you like to conceptually understand the different topics and models of Machine Learning as it exists today. Ethem does a great job at explaining the big picture through common real-life examples, using relatively standard math. It's a great book for those who don't want to learn how to program Machine Learning but would rather understand how Machine Learning might influence design, strategy, and culture."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,The book is too hard to follow. Explanations provided ramble on and on. I think the author wants to show how clever they are rather thn share knowedge.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first book on a challenging topic that I’ve been able to fully understand all the way through the end of the book. Oliver does a fantastic job translating the difference between the most popular machine learning algorithms and the ways in which each one of them works. I did have to read each section multiple times until I fully grasped the concept, if you do the same you will have a solid starter foundation upon which to build upon to start your own research."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book with full support for Matlab library.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is an overview of the many statistical methods which are associated with Machine Learning.  Unfortunately the chapter on each subject was very thin and cannot be applied without already be an expert in that area.  A good reference book, but a poor learning book."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent reference book but not the best for actually learning. This book reads like a collection of Wikipedia articles. It covers many topics and can be useful as a refresher. But if you're actually trying to learn something, look elsewhere. This book simply lays out all the formulas without much explanation."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The detail content of this book has already been written well by the other reviewers.I agree this may be currently the best textbook on machine learning.And I would need to refer this book too for understanding or relative works.But the way this book explains would be boring as encyclopedia does, enormous collections or groups of concept, less organized fashion to make a story for the subject.Before buying this book, it could be helpful to think of the trait first."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not a book that you can read chapter after chapter. That was not my expectation. But given its 1000+ pages, I was hoping it would be a good reference. Unfortunately, I did not find this book to be useful and promptly returned it. It comes across as if the author is summarizing his knowledge, irrespective of whether that material is obsolete or not, and whether it is relevant to the latest thinking. Very little on deep learning, recursive networks, reinforcement learning etc. Similarly, very little on applications such as natural language processing."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Complet and technically deep enough to undertake many ML projects. My AI class is based on that book and recommend it to anyone who want to learn ML with the probabilistic approach. Knowing Matlab helps as a complement to this book so you can transpose more easily the concept into code.
,2.0 out of 5 stars,The book is written as if it were a reference volume for a Professional already very familiar with the field. Entire subjects are simply glossed over with a reference to the journal paper  that originated the idea. Almost no background is provided for the necessary probability or conceptual background. I can't recommend this for students looking for an introduction to the field. I wish I knew of a better alternative though.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,This book does a good job of motivating modern ML theory (and the intuition behind it) and I would have given it a higher rating had it not been for the large number of typos and outright mistakes in fleshing out the details (the technical aspect). The publisher has clearly not done a good job and I would hope that buyers of this edition are provided with the option to exchange this book for a later (and hopefully) corrected edition.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A fantastic book with subtitle, ""Everything you ever wanted to know, but you were afraid to ask.""If you are serious about Machine learning and you are not satisfied with user-only approach, you will find explanations, examples and reasoning right here.I found the only flaw, the book should have twice as many pages to fit more information in."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is a comprehensive reference on statistical inference and estimation and definitely a must buy. Some of the important methods used in these areas are explained and references are given for further reading. The author did a great job in collecting so many methods. My only complaint is that method explanations are not enough which may be justified for a reference book. I would recommend it for having the whole picture of methods not as a sole book for mastering a topic.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Explanations are terrible.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The contents of the book are interesting, but I really really dislike the issues with the code. You see, the author uses a set of python modules that he wrote, and these are hiding the usage of some TF APIs that you will definitely need to learn.. elsewhere.Yes, this is not a book about Tensorflow, but at least for me, if I want to follow the examples, I'd like to learn at the same time about the different options to generate a dataset of images. Instead of just jumping into the examples, I see myself navigating through Tensorflow guides to learn how to use ImageDataGenerator to generate the dataset for an autoencoder.You can clone the code from the git repository for the book, but be aware that it has 0 comments. For example. the ""loaders.py"" that has functions used in the book to load different datasets doesn't have a single comment.Because of this annoyance, I'm dropping this to 3 stars"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only read the first two chapters (got it only yesterday) but find it superb.  Chapter 2 sums up my own slow progress for the last 10  months on my own, where I've gradually settled on TensorFlow and Keras, and the model described in the book, by observing their use in random papers and Stackoverflow discussions.  I can hardly imagine a more concise, yet sufficiently informative, description of what I have found out over these past months ... I wish I'd seen this book earlier!If the rest of the book, describing material I don't know, is as good as the part I do know, then I'm in for a real treat."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! I had a lot of fun reading this book and now I am working with that. I am an expert in AI and a creative person. Truth be told, in the 1990s I began my IT career because I was fascinated by what programming can do when it comes to art.Now I have David Foster's book here and it told me that Deep Neural Networks are perfectly capable of generating artificial content by training on the real ones. A good example is definitely generating music based on what a Neural Network learned from works of Johann Sebastian Bach. You just come up with a fitting network architecture and train it.The good thing is: The book is not restricted to just music. Music is just one use-case. Natural Language Processing for generating texts, GANs and Autoencoders for Images, you name it.And the best thing: I have to admit that the content of the book is complete and a good state of the art. There is no dust on the pages. Everything you learn is relevant today and will be for a while."

At that point I was going to give the book five stars. However, I was stuck at Autoencoders when the author suddenly started using his own code shortcuts, which was completely unexpected. It took me a while to figure it out that the code was no longer Keras but the functions and objects developed by the author, and imported from the local python files. The book does not explain any of this and the code becomes very obscure. The author's ""models"" and ""utilities"" were clearly meant to simplify development of complex neural networks by the reader. Unfortunately, the code is no longer intelligible as it hides the true Keras APIs. These shortcuts are not really necessary and the code they replace would not add much to the size of the book. In those circumstances, if you move away from the book and the author's Github repository, you will no longer be able to reproduce the models and their tests easily. While it is expected of any practitioner to develop his or her own helper library, this is not suitable for the book which needs simplicity and clarity. In all honesty, the book does not claim to train the reader in Keras at all, however, it uses Keras and asks the reader to install the software, and then explains the basics of model creation with Keras, only to leave it behind. I'd recommend to replace all obscure code with the simplest model creation, which can be found in any Keras example on the web. As the author is quite responsive to the reviews and open for comments, I have increased my rating."

The table of contents is difficult to read (14 pages of sections, chapters and paragraphs in the same underlined, bold fontsize), hyperlinks are not underlined correctly and sometimes don't work (and you cannot copy the hyperlinks!), and the most annoying error is that the python code fragments are pretty much unreadable: often there are no line breaks, so all the code is a single blob of text (really not pythonic :(. So this makes the book unreadable for me, and I'm returning the kindle book."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually avoid books on AWS I have been burned too many times. They usually read like press releases for AWS (for instance, regurgitating the ""Six Advantages of Cloud Computing"" from the AWS documentation), are not practical, or are out-of-date by the time ink hits paper.This book is a refreshing exception, providing a clear beginner-friendly overview of using the Sagemaker tools for machine learning at AWS. It has up-to-date references on all steps of the pipeline from annotating data to deploying a trained model to production. It includes coverage of boto3 (Python SDK), the Sagemaker SDK, and how to set these up on your local machine. It includes discussion of running your code online in notebook instances or in Sagemaker Studio.I recommend knowing the basics of AWS before reading this book. E.g., the kind of thing you would learn in an 'AWS Practitioner' course online: what is S3, how do you manage your account, what is an IAM role, that kind of thing. However, one thing that is nice is that for every new AWS concept it requires as background, it provides a link so you can learn about it or refresh your memory.This is the first AWS book that I've really liked -- well done!"

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I can not understand how so many people have given this book a 4 or 5 rating. 3 is the max that can be given.This book has a hands on approach to ML using python. Which is great. But thats where the greatness ends.1. The explanations in the book in general are sketchy and not thorough.2. They use code snippets in the book. Complete code has to be downloaded. However the way the code snippets are explaineddoes little to help understand the complete code. It's better to read the complete code directly.3. The code is not portable. I had to make some modifications to make some of the routines work.4. In some cases I just could not make the code work.5. They do not explain the scikit and numpy routines at a decent level of detail. So you are often left wondering how the code works,and then you have to read the scikit or numpy routine to figure this out.6. There are several perl files for a given chapter. I have no idea in which sequence to go through them.If you are a decent python programmer, and you have decent knowledge of numpy and scikits, then you will probably not find the book very frustrating. Otherwise, be ready to be frustrated.I think the reason this book is still selling is its cheap, and i think there is nothing better available.There a few books which directly discus scikits-learn. Maybe people should look at them."

I shouldn't have to jump through hurdles to read this.I wish I could get a refund."

It is a good introduction to what computers can do, and how people can get them to do it.  It is not a deep dive, but a good general discussion.  The breadth is really quite wide, from processor and instruction set internals, to memory, input/output, sound, and graphics.  These are the many things that a Raspberry Pi does.  If you are a newbie that has been blinking lights and printing ""Hello, world"" to the Pi console, this is a good next book to see the whole world under the hood of the machine."

This book is just another such outcome from this publishers. It was supposed to be a book on unsupervised learning, something which is huge in itself...And this books spends almost 1/3 or more explaining supervised learning. They have put chapters like Auto encoders and DeepNets for unsupervised learning where either they end the chapter in just 6 pages or just loath with haphazard poorey explained codes pasted from somewhere.Just not recommended. Better read some data mining book and clustering book and online tutorials which also give you very nicely explained codes."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,Read few reviews before that this book is hurried to the market.. After buying and reading it through I agree with that review.Not an exciting read. Some topics can be explained better. Expected better content going by the title of the book.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Compared to hands-on machine learning with scikit learn & tensorflow this is relatively poor.A lot of explanations don't have graphics to help explain things - I already know the basics of some unsupervised learning but the RBM description was not helpful in chapter 1.Not sure how much proof reading went on as in chapter two the recall and precision formulas both equate to the same things.Finally I found the important bit of code snippets not explained and continually had to look at the respective packages API to see what it did. Also loads of unnecessary imports were given that were not necessary eg time series chapter and all the tf and keras ones - this really obscured understanding.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Based on the title, I was hoping for a book of the same quality as Geron's ""Hands‑On Machine Learning with Scikit‑Learn and TensorFlow"". Unfortunately this is not the case and many important aspects and issues are not explained.Hardly any illustrations are helpful for the understanding of the topic. In total, the book seems like a trial to copy the concept of Geron, but without putting any effort into it. Unfortunately it's not worth the money."

Not a code Junky anyways."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,It is good on the unsupervised learning but the issue is the book is printed black and white.

Just having code is not useful since I expected the book to walk through what the code does."

Die Sprache selbst ist ja relativ trivial (und gefällt mir weiterhin nicht). Das größere Problem ist einen Überblick über das Ecosystem zu bekommen. Ich habe zunächst das durchaus brauchbare ""Learning Deep Learning"" Buch gelesen. Es wird sowohl Tensorflow als auch - als Zusatz - PyTorch Kode präsentiert. Ich habe mich für Pytorch entschieden. Die Einstiegshürde ist höher, dafür macht es einen flexibleren Eindruck.Dieses Buch war der nächste Schritt. Ich habe nun das Gefühl die prinzipielle Logik von Pytorch zu verstehen. Es enthält auch informative Hinweise was es alles so gibt. Mehr kann man von einer Pocket-Reference nicht erwarten. Von da aus kann man weiter machen.Jetzt muss ich ""nur"" mehr ein schönes Problem finden. Wobei mein Interesse entweder bei Reinforcement Learning liegt (vielleicht organisiert Kaggle wieder einen netten Spielewettbewerb) oder bei Time-Series. Damit beschäftige ich mich schon lange. Time-Series spielen allerdings im Deep-Learning Universum nur eine Nebenrolle. Ich habe für Fussball und Tennis Betfair-Inplay Wettapps geschrieben. Keine Ahnung ob man das Model mit Deep-Learning verbessern kann."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using PyTorch for a couple years and while I love the framework I don't like the boilerplate it takes sometimes.Usually when I start a project with PyTorch I find myself searching stack overflow for how to setup an optimization loop, or how to use Adam, or how to basically do anything of value. While PyTorch is very powerful it is not as easy to use as Keras in my opinion.With Joe Papa's book I find that this is much easier for me, I am using his reference to quickly find what I need to get going. So no longer am I rooting around trying to find that one article that has the special key for getting PyTorch to work.Super valuable! To anybody who uses PyTorch in the world this is a great resource to have handy so you don't get distracted with the web and can focus on delivering value with your work."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is used in an undergraduate statistics course at the University of Chicago.As a textbook for a class, I believe it does its job well. It doesn't concern itself with silly 'plug and chug' examples and presents the mathematical derivations of each technique clearly and concisely. Obviously, you'll need a background in linear algebra and probability theory. To think that the 5 page introduction to probability theory could possibly be helpful is ridiculous. It helps to also have some programming experience so you can practice implementing the techniques directly.This is written so as to be helpful as a reference book. Just the other day, I found myself implementing a parallelized feed-forward neural network and quickly picked up the text to see what variations would be helpful. Each topic is generally presented in its basic form with any alternatives and optimizations presented toward the end of the chapter. This meant it was very easy to find what I wanted in seconds.Although the book covers most of the major techniques (binary classifiers, regressions, vector support machines, neural networks, etc.) and their optimizations, it doesn't concern itself with optimal implementations. This is *not* a machine learning algorithms textbook. This is what you consult if you want to refresh yourself on a particular technique."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is really an excellent book.It is very clear and there is a excellent balancebetween the frequentist and bayesian views of severalof the models(for example, neural networks and bayesianneural networks).It would be a great idea to complement some missing parts such as""optimizacion algorithms"" and ""radial basis functions""with the lecture of the book  Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition          And, if you want to implement some of the algorithms of this book,then you should read   Netlab          , a really excelent bookthat teach you how to implement this algorithms step by step using MATLAB."

Although much of the information could be gained through websites, this is a more condensed and straightforward way to learn it.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ich habe dieses Buch für ein Open-Book-Exam gekauft. Leider konnte ich den Kurs aus zeitgründen nicht weiter belegen und somit benutze ich es jetzt als Auflagefläche für meinen Beamer. Funktioniert super! 5 Stars, would buy again."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all, as some other reviewers have pointed out, the subtitle of the book should include the word 'Bayesian' in some form or the other. The reason this is important is because the Bayesian approach, although an important one, is not adapted across the board in machine learning, and consequently, an astonishing number of methods presented in the book (Bayesian versions of just about anything) are not mainstream. The recent Duda book gives a better idea of the mainstream in this sense, but because the field has evolved in such rapidity, it excludes massive recent developments in kernel methods and graphical models, which Bishop includes.Pedagogically, however, this book is almost uniformly excellent. I didn't like the presentation on some of the material (the first few sections on linear classification are relatively poor), but in general, Bishop does an amazing job. If you want to learn the mathematical base of most machine learning methods in a practical and reasonably rigorous way, this book is for you. Pay attention in particular to the exercises, which are the best I've seen so far in such a text; involved, but not frustrating, and always aiming to further elucidate the concepts. If you want to really learn the material presented, you should, at the very least, solve all the exercises that appear in the sections of the text (about half of the total). I've gone through almost the entire text, and done just that, so I can say that it's not as daunting as it looks. To judge your level regarding this, solve the exercises for the first two chapters (the second, a sort of crash course on probability, is quite formidable). If you can do these, you should be fine. The author has solutions for a lot of them on his website, so you can go there and check if you get stuck on some.As far as the Bayesian methods are concerned, they are usually a lot more mathematically involved than their counterparts, so solving the equations representing them can only give you more practice. Seeing the same material in a different light can never hurt you, and I learned some important statistical/mathematical concepts from the book that I'd never heard of, such as the Laplace and Evidence Approximations. Of course, if you're not interested, you can simply skip the method altogether.From the preceding, it should be clear that the book is written for a certain kind of reader in mind. It is not for people who want a quick introduction to some method without the gory details behind its mathematical machinery. There is no pseudocode. The book assumes that once you get the math, the algorithm to implement the method should either become completely clear, or in the case of some more complicated methods (SVMs for example), you know where to head for details on an implementation. Therefore, the people who will benefit most from the book are those who will either be doing research in this area, or will be implementing the methods in detail on lower level languages (such as C). I know that sounds offputting, but the good thing is that the level of the math required to understand the methods is quite low; basic probability, linear algebra and multivariable calculus. (Read the appendices in detail as well.) No knowledge is needed, for example, of measure-theoretic probability or function spaces (for kernel methods) etc. Therefore the book is accessible to most with a decent engineering background, who are willing to work through it. If you're one of the people who the book is aimed at, you should seriously consider getting it.Edited to Add:I've changed my rating from 4 stars to 5. Even now, 4-5 years later, there is simply no good substitute for this book."

After the 9GB download for chapter 5, the supplied source doesn't work and contains requirements to 32bit libs... huge waste of time...2. After moving onto in chapter 6, and after 24 hours of downloading tweets for sentiment analysis... I checked the files and they only contained ""The Twitter REST API v1 is no longer active.

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this book with great expectations. Indeed, the first three chapters met those expectations. But at Chap. 4 - Generative Deep Learning - it turned into the book from hell! First off, the author breezily tells us we're going to use the well-known celebrity face file CelebA, and provides a shareable link. But he doesn't tell us how to download a file using a shareable link. And the file is HUGE so it has to be zipped. I spent a day trying to download this file. In the end I gave up and downloaded it from a completely different website using instructions I found on github. That was just the beginning of the ordeal. Then the code the author provided had bugs...lots of bugs. There was the ""objecte can't be pickled bug"", the ""object can't be called"" bug, the ""object called before it has been initialized"" bug and...on and on. In some cases I figured out a workaround. In others I altered the authors code. Finally, the ""ValueError: None values not supported"" bug, buried 11 frames deep into the code, did me in.  I gave up, cursing myself that I had spent a week on this fruitless and ultimately futile effort. I am writing this review to warn prospective buyers of this book. If you're a coding expert (which I'm not), perhaps you will have more luck. But in any case, caveat emptor!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a ML engineer. I know the ropes. I've spent hours surfing the web for explanations and sample implementations of deep learning and GAN methodology. You might have too. You might be wondering, ""why would I need this book when I have access to Medium?"" And that's a good question. I can answer that for you.If you've been around for a while, you might know that Medium content can be repetitive, unoriginal, full of too much filler, full of code that can't be re-used, or in the habit of explaining mathematics/probability poorly. The difference between this book and Medium is that this book doesn't do that. It's got good introductions to each popular dataset, contains useful code, is highly readable and refreshing, and uses equations sparingly and effectively, without dumbing down the content too much. I can skim the content easily. It's top notch, contains a lot of fresh developments like World Models (Ch 8), and seems like an essential book for my ML library.My only critique is that at times, the book seemed to read like a children's bedtime story. Telling stories is an excellent way to explain concepts, but I don't know if I need David Foster renaming GAN discriminators and generators ""Di and Gene"", with an introduction on ""taking photographs of ganimals"" to understand what a GAN is. That's not to say this book does the story bit poorly. If you're new to all this, it may be really useful for you. It was just a bit off-putting for me.Regardless, I highly recommend it to anyone that has familiarity with basic stats notation and is comfortable with Python3."

""models.RNNAttention"" produced errors, and there's no explanation of how to get around this I could find anywhere in the text. Perhaps this is one of the things mentioned in a previous review. ""the author suddenly started using his own code shortcuts, which was completely unexpected.... The book does not explain any of this and the code becomes very obscure. ...the code is no longer intelligible.The text for the code in the Kindle edition is also almost transparent, and very difficult to read, even on a 32 inch monitor at maximum settings."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,These generative models are both simple and hard. It is a simple idea with a lot of potential and possibility. But it is very hard to make it work.

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Machine Learning Automation with TPOT – ReviewFirst, I would like to congratulate Mr. Dario Radečić, the book's author, and I am delighted to review this cutting-edge technical book as part of the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning series (AIML).Overview:The author kept me on the edge of my seat and reading word for word from the beginning, and the way he organized each chapter was awesome. The author went from basics to advanced level concepts with clear along with excellent examples without getting bored, and a comprehensible way of each section from Idea of Automation, Practical Classification, Regression, and Neural Networks. At one level, things went into top gear and landed on the Deployed TPOT Model in Production, which was simply outstanding. I am sure every reader will take away a substantial amount of understanding and knowledge of the Machine Learning algorithm and the power pack of the TPOT. Perfectly author mentioned that “TPOT is your data science assistant. You can use it to automate everything. boring in a data science project.”What I like:Chapter 2,3 & 4""Deep Dive into TPOT"" is a particularly important chapter with respect to the title of the book. Yes! Of course, the author has covered this topic well by giving the in-detail level of installing and configuring the TPOT library for standalone Python and Anaconda. If you follow the steps carefully, you will certainly get TPOT in your environment in a very few minutes. Followed by this, the author takes us to explore various datasets and all the ML processes on a touch basis and the crystal-clear implementation of the Regression and Classification model with a reasonable volume of datasets with appropriate features and detailed step by step coding was excellent and helpful, even those who are new to ML world and knowledgeable in ML space. And TPOT came into play as the final match-winning striker and exporting the optimized pipeline new python file for further usage was impressive. Even I have tried them and enjoyed the output.Chapter 5I would say ""Parallel Training with TPOT and Dask"" is an extra bounce for the readers and thank you very much for bringing those topics into the book for the benefit of Data Scientists and ML Engineers. The parallelism concept in Python reminds me of the threading concept in Java programming, and the sample set of examples and code was an excellent feed for the readers. Coming into Dask library usage and its advantage over data processing with sample code is notable.Chapter 6 & 7Another milestone in this book is the Crash Course in Neural Networks, in which the author quickly covered the theory of a single neuron, the theory of a single layer, and various activation functions in a rapid way. Using neural networks to classify handwritten digits in a sample program was extraordinary, Anyone can understand the author's approach and way of implementation. And the Neural Network Classifier with TPOT as well.What I didn’t like:With respect to TPOT Model Deployment and Using the Deployed TPOT Model in Production This book's chapters appear to be power packs, but they appear rushed, and if there were more details about different model implementations, I believe something similar to the earlier deep-dive would be helpful for readers. And I believe that the author might have thought of, it would be too much for the readers, resulting in a diluting of the rhythm.What I would like to see:I was expecting the training machine learning models with TPOT and Dask libraries with a reasonable data set, which was discussed in the initial chapters, would help readers to understand how to connect the dots. And one more thing is the goal is to create a file from an automation library, It would be great if we have detailed explanation/coverage of the optimized pipeline of a new python file for the readers; if we understood this, it would be an additional value-added as a take away from this book.Overall … I can give 4.5/5 for this. And all the absolute best for the author."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book gives you a hands-on approach to learning by doing. As opposed to the trendy deep learning books that dive deep into the weeds from the start, this book starts with the more traditional ML approaches (the Scikit-learn part) giving you a great deal of context and practical tools for solving all kinds of problems. Only after does he transition into deep learning concepts, giving you both a great overview and the background to understand when and where to apply the various techniques. Its code-focused so you'll have the option to run working code on real problems throughout the book.Most important for me, he focuses on explanation over hand-wavy equations that are rampant in other ML books. I say hand-wavy because they typically go like so: ""Here's a hard concept. Rather than explain it well, I'll give you some linear algebra and calculus equations, remind you that this is stuff you should have learned in high school, and then move on."" Authors probably feel justified in doing this, but after reading a book like this you understand what they are really doing: Skipping the hard-part of breaking difficult concepts down into chunks that can be consumed by a competent programmer, who is perhaps not an expert in ""high school"" math. Moreover, this author does so without dumbing down the content.  That's the mark of someone who well understands both the content and the audience.This book is long and dense, and serves as both a guide and a reference. It is not a quick read / overview or light reading type book."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"-I've already spent several tens of hours with this book. The Kindle version is (I consider) overly expensive considering the number of issues.-Many of the notebooks and/or book code examples do not work and/or take inordinate amounts of time to compute.-I can't count the number of times I've already had to go off and spend an hour or more updating or changingcode so that it works, whether it be from the book or from the latest notebooks (which the author claims tokeep up to date).-Explanations are often poor. For instance, when discussing false positives, false negatives, etc... He could havejust put all definitions in one place, like on wikipedia, but instead he tries to ""word"" everything out. It's not a very methodical way of instruction.-Another python book with so many breaking inter-dependencies that it boggles the mind - yet the author implies that ""from the ground up"" solutions are just ""toys."" Well, at least those toys will not break down when some part of your byzantine collection of libraries is updated."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am only in the early chapters so far, but I noticed that it is very well written.  It helps that this is a 2nd edition.  ML concepts are not easy to explain clearly, so the author has done a fine job.  Part 2 deep learning seems totally new to the 2nd edition.  I was mostly interested in deep learning and was almost going to skip part 1, but am glad I didn’t.  I am getting a concise review of basic ML in part 1.Re Kindle version, I am happy to report that the formatting works well.  Code is easy to read and math formulas show up well.  There is also color in graphs.  O’Reilly print books are only in black and white and some graphs can’t be read because all lines or dots are the same black color.  No problem here.  I was able to get Alexa to read the book to me in a very realistic voice.  I used iPad pro, installed Alexa app on it, then from the Alexa app, I opened the Kindle book, choose chapter, and pressed play.  Alexa correctly pronounced scikit-learn, which is an achievement.  Speech engine seems much improved and sounds very good.  Connected a bluetooth headset. forward, back, pause, resume buttons on headset works."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was debating giving this book two stars but I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and consider that there probably is a certain audience that would find this book helpful.  That audience is beginning young computer enthusiasts and makers (Arduino/Raspberry Pi) and college sophomores supplementing their basic Digital Design coursework.To start, lets talk about what this book is not, and that I believe most buyers like myself, were hoping it would be.  This book is not about how Eben Upton developed the Raspberry Pi.  There are no chapters dealing with spec-ing active and passive components, PCB layout, MCU selection, voltage and current considerations, writing firmware, selecting and customizing an OS, programming on-board chips, re-configurable logic, networking chips, or integrating peripherals.  What you are basically getting for thirty dollars  is Schaum's Outline of Computer Architecture ($3 used) with some updated material and hand-waving at the Raspberry Pi.  Perhaps a better description of this book is that of  a dumbed down, college sophomore version of the unpleasant yet venerable Patterson and Hennessy CompArch tome we all had the misfortune of reading as an academic, and non-practical, soporific. So really read over the table of contents for this book and realize you are buying a book on generic computer architecture with very little Raspberry Pi specific details.  If you think this book is going to give you any practical insights for building your own computer, or how that process works, forget it, this is purely an academic/theoretically introduction covering generic computer basics.Two final points: I highly doubt Eben Upton had much to do with writing this book besides being listed as the author and writing or approving the introduction.  An computer system architect as brilliant as Eben would not bore himself on this mundane of an introductory, generic text.  More likely this was a project assigned to some less talented interns who mainly accumulated previously published computer architecture material and reworded it for this book slightly for the Pi.  Finally I'll make a plea to the elite computer architect community for the book we really want: an updated version of ""Designing Embedded Hardware by John Catsoulis"".  If a qualified Computer Architect could give us a Raspberry Pi (or other SBC) version of this outdated but wonderful book I will buy twenty copies myself.  I believe that is the book everybody really wants not this boring and disappointing book."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book lives up to its name as a well-put together guide for ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS. The author handles the subject with brevity but clear prose.It answered a lot of my questions and the blank spots I had re: what’s the difference between ML and standard computing programming and how ML works in terms of statistical modelling.The book doesn’t go too deep into any particular part of ML but the chapter on ANN was particularly insightful in tackling a fairly challenging subject within ML.As a standalone book it won’t be enough to train yourself to become a machine learning engineer – although it does include a chapter on job & study options – so it really should be used as an entry point to ML and not a comprehensive guide. To be honest, I’d still be CLUELESS if I went to my CLI today and wanted to start a machine learning model. But for a few bucks this book has done its job and I feel much more confident tackling other introductory resources to Scikit Learn and Tensorflow now that I have all the basic principles and terminology fresh in my head."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This book was the textbook for the Machine Learning course I've taken and I can't say I found it very useful for learning the material on my own. This book is much more of a reference book than a self-learning book. It feels like the author's purpose was to include all the material in the field into a single, huge book. From that perspective, this is probably the most expansive book; you won't probably find any book talking about deep learning for example. However, when you're reading this book, you feel like the book was a bit rushed, it wasn't quite ready to be published. There is at least one typo in every page and a lot of them makes you wonder how that typo was missed. For example, all the algorithm references in text use wrong numbers.One other thing, maybe again because it was a bit rushed, the book is not well organized. Most of the time you feel like the author took a bunch of sections written in different times and simply pasted them one after another. There is no coherent narrative that takes you through the text.In short, although I appreciate the effort, I must say I'm disappointed with this book, especially given the hype about this book. I think this book needs some serious review, and first of all some proofreading."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is just a book like introduction to algorithms. It covers a lot of topics which cleans every corner of machine learning. The book is even better since it cuts the very edge of technology.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a heavy book that contains a great overview and does a good job at explaining key concepts. I think it's a must-have.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent book, covering almost all of KDB+."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,not easy reading and not for beginners .
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a comprehensive machine learning book. Author tries to emcompass all the related topics in one book, so that it is thick. The good thing is that all the figures in the book can be drawn by pmtk3."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was happy to see a title on unsupervised learning. But my enthusiasm faded as soon as I received the book and started reading. All the examples are pretty trivial. The explanations of topics leading up to examples is where I have problem. The explanations are very shallow, just as good as online documentation of various packages. This book seems to have been hurried to hit the market. Too expensive for the content. Oreilly seems to be churning out too many titles without quality these days to cash in on the trend. Hands-On ML 2nd edition seem to have similar code examples. Hope to see better theory in that that book, just like the first edition which did not have dedicated chapter on Unsupervised Learning."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes for this book as it's one of the few that seemed to tackle semi-supervised learning. Its very disappointing. The code is riddled with bugs. There are some beginner mistakes, like scaling the days before splitting it. Much of the content is very very high level. As someone who does quite a few cluster models, the coverage of k-means is so high level that I doubt a newbie could produce a quality model based on this book. The absence of dendograms for hierarchical clustering is bizarre. The use of labeled datasets won't serve newbies well at all. What will they do in the real world without those labels? How else could they validate their model?Hands on Machine Learning provides better coverage of unsupervised learning. Avoid this book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a must-read for anyone interested in building AI applications. The introduction and conclusion are clear and informative, and the main content and code examples are forward thinking. All industry professionals, from data scientists to executives should read this book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been looking to add more machine learning to my developer toolbox and this book was the absolute best thing I could find on the web.  The author is NOT some  professor who makes his living writing books, but a man at the edge of the space who has fought for the knowledge and experience in the real world.I love how the book takes you from ground up implementing real systems in python.  Not just unfinished snippets to show you how the m/l packages work (you can read their docs for that!)  but he fills in the rest of the bigger picture which is ""how do i make something that actually accomplishes a task in the world""  your college prof probably has never had to ask that.At $50 it's a steal, pickup a copy and don't look back."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So currently I work as a data scientist, but my main focus is supervised learning and time-series analysis. I got this book to help me brush up on some skills and learn some new ones. This book runs with the suggestion that you already have a good understanding of python, both in terms of general use and data cleansing. Not only does it walk you threw some projects, but if you take time to break down the code and attempt to understand the “why am I using this” instead of “what do I have to replace for my own job” you will learn a lot more.Personally, I love these kind of books because it shows you multiple ways to test a model, recommends you run multiple models, and even use some underrated features of python. If you have a decent foundation, in python and stats (optional), i highly recommend this book."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to write a higher star for this book.  There just isn't enough meat regarding the topics I was looking for, specifically metric evaluation in a completely unsupervised situation.  It's kind of cheating if you throw in a target variable and compare the predicted cluster to the real cluster.  Where's the metric evaluation when you don't have a target variable?  I haven't seen the section or it's missing.  Plus nearly the first hundred pages of the book is going over supervised learning for some reason."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a reference manual, not an instruction guide to the k database. It covers a great deal of the q language used in the database interface. However there is little discussion on the API or how to write an interface to the database from any computer language.re three GUIs( qStudio, Q Insight Pad, and the Console ) mentioned in the book. However, the screenshots are far to small to be read and their source is problematical. Also, the commercial price of kdb can reach $1000, so be sure to read the disclaimer carefully before you get the free version to avoid violating the contract.The $15 price for the book is very attractive and is well worth the money, but you may need to buy the other pricy reference book to be able to utilize the database fully.The fast storage and retrieval capability of this database relative to a MySQL or SQL Server database will be well worth the effort when you have several gigabytes of data to analyze. But, you are going to have to put in many hours of study and programming the interface before you can make this database work for you."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an algo quant working on a daily basis with kdb+/q, I can confirm that this book covers most of important aspect of q, in particular when working with tick-by-tick data and building data analytics.The first two parts are very useful for beginners to q. Part three and four contains basic yet essential statistics/ml recipes and can be enjoyed for intermediate/advanced users.In general, the book is well structured and easy to read. Strongly recommended to anyone who wants to learn about data analysis (not necessarily big data), machine learning and foremost, q/kdb+."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an analyst trying to get more into the world of machine learning and python, I thought this was a great resource. I've been briefly exposed to a lot of the content in this book before, but this book does a great job of breaking concepts down with clear code examples and visualizations. I'd recommend this to any individuals or analytics teams trying to expand their knowledge of machine learning."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I focus on supervised classification in a domain specific area at work.. and would love to find an unsupervised labeling scheme that gets me at least partly to a properly tagged dataset.  We don't get the IRIS dataset in the real world.  This book had several helpful examples which I tossed in the development hopper as preliminary ideas for better feature engineering.  I look forward to future versions with Pytorch and / or Snorkel examples.

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am quite confused about what to feel about this book, if you are looking for a completely non-technical text giving a brief overview this book certainly does fit but if you are searching for a light introduction (like me) to machine learning field including the methodologies and the theory as well this book is a no go."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The author tackles machine learning from a very philosophical slant.  I think this is a pretty strange approach for a subject that a very broad spectrum of people are curious about.  On the other hand, if you have a fairly decent technical, mathematical and scientific background as I have, a fairly fluffy technical discussion with a good philosophical perspective is satisfactory.  I think that writing a mass paperback on machine learning is a tough sell from the philosophical approach, which many (especially those who want to jump on the job bandwagon in data science) will certainly find unhelpful.  I liked, actually, the fairly superficial discussions of numerous fairly up-to-date technologies in machine learning.  I do not fool myself, however.  It is also necessary to have at least some knowledge of the more technical, mathematical aspects, as in Alpaydin's machine learning text that this short paperback was, to some extent, drawing on.  I recommend this book if you want a quick, superficial tour of relatively modern machine learning technology.  It is obviously a book of no or little interest to the pro, undergrad major or grad student in related areas of data science.  I suspect a fairly good audience would be freshman or high school students interested in machine learning."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I would have given this book three stars, but as it so prominently displays ""MIT Press"" I am holding it to a slightly higher expectation level. It's not a very good book. I have three main complaints. First, the editing is atrocious, or maybe there simply was no editing. There are many very simple typo errors that should have been caught by even a novice editor, or perhaps by a machine editor. It's not a huge deal but it makes the book seem rushed. My second complaint is that the material is incredibly basic. If you know anything about computers, the first thirty pages (out of 200) can be skipped. After that it is still incredibly basic but might have some material that is new to a novice to this area. And finally, as others have noted, the structure of the book is very poor. It seems like the author may have just cranked this out in one sitting, without any consideration of how to present the material. Of course this is meant to be ""conversational AI"" rather than a real textbook, but it goes way beyond that into what I would call ""stream of consciousness AI"". Altogether these make for a less-than-satisfying read."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this book thinking a book published by MIT would really be above other books on Machine Learning (ML); what it is and how it functions from a technical and theoretical perspective.  My opinion is that this book misses the expectations that I set for it.- There is a lot of high level redundant wording throughout the book.  In the first 3 chapters the author talks about some of the basic issues with ML from a statistics perspective on a some-what meaningless topic (the value of a used car).  I gleaned nothing additional that made me question how to create a ""used car"" algorithm better.- This book hasn't enlightened me further that would allow me to consider what to do with data or how to build an algorithm, or how ML ties into Artificial intelligence (AI) or what AI is in relation to human intelligence.  There is a little bit of information; however, it such a high level, if you bought this book to further your knowledge, you already what researchers are hypothesizing.- The date of publication for the book is 2016, which is only 4 years ago; however, on the first page of Chapter 3, the author states ""recently two-dimensional matrix barcodes have been proposed...""  Say what?  Two-dimensional barcodes were registered in the late 1990's early 2000's and were being used by 2005.  I'm not sure how an author writing a book in 2015/2016 could claim that two-dimension matrix barcodes are just being proposed, which then brings into question the current-ness of their information.  This is a huge issue for me.- Although I am on Chapter 5 and not yet finished, I readily skipped paragraphs in the first 3 chapters because of the ""basic"" nature of the discussion in the paragraph.  I found Chapter 4 on Deep Learning better; however, nothing that wow'ed me.  You can find better and more thorough explanations on YouTube for Deep Learning.All in all, not a worthwhile investment to learning about ML."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I found this mini book an asset to providing me with relevant information on this subject and in a manner that was intelligent and easily comprehensible on such a relatively complex topic. This is an excellent introductory book on this subject and especially so for the layman or management level individual looking to thoroughly be acquainted with a rational basis on the technology, concepts and computational origins and applications of machine learning methods, tools and techniques.  This is also an excellent springboard book for beginners whom are seeking a general foundation of machine learning as part of a career choice or if involved in data science projects in the workplace. Very pleased with the quality, content and value of this book; I highly recommend it and will explore purchasing other titles in this series."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,A very brief but interesting and thorough enough introduction to the field. It manages to convey the fields own structures and patterns in a way superior to any of the learning algorithms ... yet. The author is a little to quick to dismiss the dangers of strong AI based on machine learning - or otherwise. There are different points of view on this all worth considering. But he brushes it all off in a paragraph.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a big fan of Bishop's earlier ""Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition"" despite my not being particularly interested in neural networks (as opposed to other aspects of machine learning), and so I was pretty excited when I heard about this book.  Reading it has not left me disappointed.  Like his earlier book, this text is quite mathematically oriented, and not well-suited for people who aren't comfortable with calculus.  However, also like in ""NNPR"", the writing style here is very clear, and everything past basic calculus and linear algebra is well-explained before it's needed.  The appendices alone are a goldmine.  (Appendix B is a great ""cheat sheet"" for commonly used probability distributions; Appendix C has lots of useful matrix properties you may have forgotten or never known; Appendix D quickly explains what you need to know about the calculus of variations; and Appendix E does the same for Lagrange multipliers.)  The author also does an excellent job throughout the text of marrying math and intuition without giving either short shrift.However, note that the material covered is inherently pretty complex, so the book can still be intimidating in parts despite the excellent writing.  It's more appropriate for, say, Ph.D. students and professional researchers in statistics or machine learning than people who just want to crank out code for a simple classifier.  There is very little pseudocode (although copious MATLAB code will supposedly be made available in a companion book due out in 2008), and the book's overall approach to machine learning is basically hard-core Bayesian statistics.  If you are not willing to scratch your head for a while over lots and lots of equations, this may not be the book for you.On the flip side, people who are already experts in machine learning may be mildly disappointed with the lack of coverage some of their pet topics get.  For example, while the chapter on graphical models is excellent as far as it goes, it only mentions the problem of learning graphical model structures (one of my areas of interest) in passing.  Reinforcement learning (another personal area of interest) is discussed briefly in the introduction and then written off as beyond the scope of the book.However, the book is already a fabulous resource as it stands; complaining there's not even more of it would be gauche.  The cover may look like goat barf, and there are some innocuous missing words here and there (hey, it's a first edition), but if you're serious about machine learning and not afraid of a little math, you should definitely own this book.  I can only imagine how much cooler my own thesis research might have been if this book had been around a few years earlier."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good book
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great reference on Pattern Recognition and, clearly, is based on others classical books on this theme (Richard O. Duda, for instance). But, the Math used throughout the book is quite difficult and the author didn't address the theory behind the math  with the  rigor expected and observed in classical engineering authors. But, as i wrote above, this is a necessary reference for every one enrolled with this subject on these days."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a PhD student in machine learning. Bishop is really gifted and he explains very well basic and advanced concepts of machine learning. I would say that this book is much more comprehensive than Hastie's Statistical learning book   The Elements of Statistical Learning          . Very good illustrations and very complete. I would definitely recommend it for those who want to learn statistical/machine learning on their own. The only thing that I don't like is that it often tries to present theories under a probabilistic framework. My personal opinion is that Probabilities is a nice way to present easy theories in a super complex way. I tend to think in a more linear algebra/optimization framework. After so many years in Academia probabilities still confuse me.  Hopefully the author doesn't use only the probabilistic framework, that is why I like it"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"good book, poor printing quality"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book presents an insightful, advanced account of a subset of topics in machine learning (see the ToC). You get excellent references, rigorous (mathematical) explanations and deep connections. There are proofs or explanations that are difficult to follow, but they are worth the effort. Some criticisms are valid here as I notice a few areas where an extra line here or there would better guide the reader, but I find working through the details by whatever means necessary is always infinitely more rewarding. If you get stuck, find lecture notes, or ask someone. In summary, this is an excellent *second* book on machine learning."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"excellent book overall. This semester, a few of us working on our PhD degrees in ECE at Purdue University decided to form a study group and teach Machine Learning to each other. We looked into a few machine learning books and decided that Bishop's book is most suitable for us as new comers to machine learning. After going over a few chapters in details, I would highly recommend this book to people who want to study Machine Learning on their own provided that they have sufficient background in calculus, linear algebra and probability theory."

I also bought the e-book which came with a really fun interactive book as well as the kindle and pdf of this edition and a previous edition by another Author.Thank You Very Much For Writing Such An Amazing Piece. I Will Be Using This For Years To Come."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Book is extremely well written. Given the amount of material it covers (regression, classification, clustering, & issues germane to use of these technique types), Knox presents the material very economically in just 320 pages. Highly appreciate use of color in figures, which is like a breath of fresh air after slogging through B/W figures in other books. Among the relevant issues he includes are chapters “Communication with Clients” and “Current Challenges in Machine Learning”—two excellent additions. Another welcome addition is R source code. One pet peeve—the formatting of vectors and matrices is the same as for scalars. I highly recommend this book for those studying machine learning, data analysis, data mining, etc."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this book for graduate level machine learning course. Book was extremely helpful in understanding theory. It really helped when I didn't understand the instructor's lecture. If you are looking for theory book I think this is the best book if you are industry person you might not like the book that much but as a graduate student who is new to the subject this book will help tremendously to understand the concept and dive in deep.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great book to explore major ideas behind state-of-the-art generative deep learning techniques. It covers variational autoencoders, encoder-decoder based approaches, GANs, and much more with code examples in book’s github repo.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally found a very Mastering Azure Machine Learning book!Overview of the book:The book starts with an overview of an end-to-end ML project and a guide on howto choose the right Azure service for different ML tasks.It then focuses on Azure Machine Learning and takes you through the process of data experimentation,data preparation, and feature engineering using Azure Machine Learning and Python.You will learn advanced feature extraction techniques using natural language processing (NLP).AudienceThis machine learning book is for data professionals, data analysts, data engineers, datascientists, or machine learning developers who want to master scalable cloud-basedmachine learning architectures in Azure. This book will help you use advanced Azureservices to build intelligent machine learning applications. A basic understanding ofPython and working knowledge of machine learning are mandatory.What I liked:The Introduction is well written, and the good part is we have download resources links as well.It has details for Azure end to end ML Pipeline, Performing descriptive data exploration,Common techniques for data preparations, choosing right ML Model, optimize techniques, and Deploying and operating models.They have given good points around choosing a ML service in Azure also have details on Azure Cognitive Services, custom vision,GUIs and workspace. I liked the data experiment and visualization using Azure. Found more details on ETL, Data Preparation and feature extraction.You will also see details on building ML models using Azure ML and training deep neural networks on Azure.Found hyperparameter tuning and automated ML with understanding examples.Well explained MLOps-DevOps for ML.What I Disliked:The book is well-written, however I think we still have scope of more screen shots.What would I like to See?Azure cost and more on ML Automation."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Over all content of the book is very good to start on Azure ML labs but certain areas are missing the key peaces for data scientist. Data preparation is not covered extensively where Data scientist typically struggle a lot to munch and crunch the data for feature extraction.Data science background is prerequisite to start this book since most of the DS concepts are referred with the assumption of knowing it before. However the Azure ML platform and Algorithms are covered very well to experiment.Overall I liked the book covering all concepts on machine learning in Azure.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm captivated by this book. Just went through the first chapter and this is exactly what I need. Besides the Azure part, it is a pretty well-rounded ML book itself."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is a must read for data scientists in petroleum engineering. Very well written.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are looking to learning more about Data Science I highly recommend this book. The only stipulation is that if you have not used math or statistics for a couple years that you read ""Practical Statistics for Data Scientists"" first, or you may be a little lost. While this is an introduction to Machine Learning, it is not an introduction to Python, Linear Algebra, Calculus, or Statistics. You can still follow along with the code and science explanations, but if you are novice in math or programming just be ready to spend a couple hours researching a single paragraph from this book. This is not a bad thing and actually a strength of this book. Once you understand the fundamental concepts, the author concisely and accurately shows you how to implement the model.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best book you can buy if you want to implement machine learning to your project.What I really like about this is a book is that the author knows how to explain ML concepts by solving a real-world example problem, as opposed to just explaining the theory.Strong MATH knowledge isn't required to understand this book(just the basic and you can learn the concept as you go), however, strong programming knowledge is required based on my personal experience."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have reviewed several books on Machine Learning and this book is the best in class.  I am using it as a text to go along with Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning on Coursera!  Thanks!
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm 100 pages into this book, and while the content is great, the formatting of the code snippets is atrocious.  If you are thinking about the e-book, don't buy it, get the physical copy."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very thoroughly written
,4.0 out of 5 stars,The quality of sheets is poor. Even the cover is too thin. But the book provides an excellent insight into Artificial Intelligence.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The book covers almost all topics, but the thing is all topics are not equally elaborated. This book is lengthy for no reason. Unbiased statements about some concepts is given. Although some concepts are given eloquently, some are just verbose with un supported claims.But still, good book to go through, but be quicker than what i s expected."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased ebook edition for this book. But that doesn't open in my kindle device
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well written and rather easy to follow. You will need to google a bit, especially if you do not have a real background in calculus and linear algebra. Linear algebra is introduced briefly at the beginning, but in my opinion it is not enough. He goes too fast with no much explanation of how subsequent equations are derived. Nevertheless, I recommend this book for anybody who need solid bases in machine learning. For a stats background, including the necessary maths to understand it, I prefer ""Lectures on Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics"" by Marco Taboga. I think the combination of both books give some real foundations for data scientists."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is one of the few technical books that I've read cover to cover. One of the strongest points of the book is that it provides a story. Starting with Least Squares method applied to Olympic 100m dataset, moving on to Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Bayesian regression and Bayesian inference in general, all the way to more complicated methods such as classification, clustering, PCA. All these topics are applied to the same datasets so the reader can see a good comparison of the methods. Most importantly, very little is assumed about reader's maths abilities.The second part of the book is more advanced and covers: Gaussian Processes, MCMC, and Mixture Models.One of my most favourite things is the explanation of PCA using light and shade as the projection (see the attached image)"
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The authors spent a lot of effort for explaining the topics but there are too many typos and mistakes, even in the second edition.For example, in the definition of a positive definite matrix  A (x^t AX >0) it is not stated that x should be nonzero.In Chapter 2, they use w and hat(w) and sometimes they call w to be a random variable, sometimes hat(w), alwaysa mixed up.  A considerable effort is needed to correct these typos and mistakes."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great book, as others say there is no information that remains un-resolved. All maths is clear and easy to follow, would recommend it as your first book on ML."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, accessible book! The authors write like they have nothing to prove unlike most textbooks, very refreshing!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In my opinion, this is by far the best introduction to Machine Learning. It accomplishes something I would think impossible: it assumes essentially only high school mathematics and no statistics background, and yet, by introducing math, probability and statistics as needed, it manages to do an entirely rigorous introduction to Machine Learning. Proofs are not provided only for very few theorems; the book goes fairly deep and is really enjoyable to read. I told my students that this book will be one of the best investments they have ever made!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am impressed with the writing style and the approach the author uses to methodically explain the topic at hand. I get it the moment I read a page; I highly recommend this book
,2.0 out of 5 stars,The writer hasn't explained some of those concepts very well.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An excellent introduction to the subject, accessible and clearly written but covering a good deal of ground and encouraging the reader to build and experiment with a range of machine learning techniques."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The book seemed good so far, the first project doesn’t mention the #includes in the text but if you go to website for source code works fine and much fun. Reason for the 2 stars is the poor quality of printing I thought it was a fake at first, all black and white prints in on images and headers."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a lovely book which guides you carefully through the different level of deep learning. The examples are inspired by real-world problems and help a lot for visibility. The coded examples of the webpage are a little nasty and should be reformated.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally, someone who explains this so students can understand it. This is hands down the book you want to start with. The other popular book groking algorithms has a wonderful first chapter but the rest of the book is meh. This book is enlightening all the way through. Thank you for writing it!"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this textbook and enjoying it so far!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a software developer by trade and I have always been interested specifically in artificial intelligence (and to a lesser degree, computer learning). This book is an overview of some of the subtopics in these fields, though it is not typical in the approach. Instead of addressing each in a theoretical, scholarly manner like a textbook, it instead provides a much more hands-on approach and leads the reader through a series of exercises designed to demonstrate the material. The approach is engaging and actually fun.First, a word about computer languages: the author explains that the primary languages in used here are Python, C++ and Javascript, though other languages can be used. I personally like Perl and C++, so as I work through the examples and learn I have been using Perl, and it works well enough for me. I could possibly make life easier on myself by using a different language, but the idea is to learn the material, not struggle with a computer language.Also: It really helps to have a mathematical background. The author presents several mathematical formulas to back up the material and explain the methods, and for someone who isn’t mathematically inclined these will potentially be intimidating. If you aren’t strong in math this will hinder understanding but will not be a complete show-stopper.The author presents ten exercises that demonstrate an abstract topic in AI and/or machine learning. The first exercise is described as helping a turtle escape a bag. This is the same base process as a breadth-first search, though there are some additional factors in the overall system that complicate the calculations. The next exercise builds on the first and recreates the bag with data captured from the first exercise. Not all exercises are related, though, and many are independent of the others. One particular exercise provides an interesting approach to creating artificial life using the classic Game of Life as a starting point to a more complex variation.The formula this book follows is consistent across all of the exercises. The author presents the problem to be solved, a mission statement, a how-to section, implementation, analysis of the result and finally topics for further learning. This works well.This is not a comprehensive study on either machine learning or artificial intelligence. If it was so, it would be a huge book weighing several pounds (and probably would have more errors due to the sheer quantity of material). What is here, though, is a good starting point with a fun introduction. As I worked with this book I felt it would be a good book for use in a classroom as a lab book for advanced students.If you have an interest in computer learning or artificial intelligence, this is a nice starting point. It’s not as heady and intellectual as many others are and it does not rely on the theory to carry itself. Instead, it is a work book that can be done outside of a classroom and worked at your own pace. The material is interesting and the exercises more engaging. It isn’t a comprehensive study of the whole field, but more of an involved introduction. This is an easy book to recommend, based on my work with it."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the print edition of this book for review. So for some background, I've been a programmer for over 30 years. I did research in GA's in the late 90s, and have not kept up with GA/ML/NN since then. I have gone through quite a few of the exercises and found the analogies and instruction to be excellent.This is exactly the book I needed to get oriented again. I found the brief histories of the technologies accurate and interesting, and the author leaves lots of little tidbits for you to expand your knowledge, such as the discussion of L-systems (which I honestly have not thought about since the late 80s).If you're at all interested in the subject matter and need an introductory text, have at it. This is a fantastic book."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This could have been a good book but it relies heavily on examples that are unengaging and uses references to colour keyed datasets in graphs that are printed in black and white.  Sloppy editing and a generally disappointing book, would not recommend."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Livre bien fait.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book teaches you the best practices of data science and machine learning based on real world case studies. I found this highly valuable because you are able to actually work on real data sets. This is also a quick way to learn industry recognized tools and mathematical concepts that are actually being used by data scientist. Another advantage of this book in my opinion is the author's approach for coding. Author writes and explains each code and outcome separately rather than giving you several paragraphs of code and explain them all at once. I strongly recommend this book if you want to learn data science and machine learning on a practical level applying code and assessing the outcome
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you already have some (minimal) python experience under your belt and want to have a detailed walk-through of a Data Science project, this is the book for you. Steve goes in depth on the what, why and how when it comes to exploring, cleaning, modeling and presenting a project in a business setting. He does a very good job of explaining what exactly is happening in the code used throughout the book. This really made the book great for a beginner/intermediate data scientist like myself. These explanations really helped me get a better understanding of pandas and scikit-learn. The best part about the book is that he goes into detail on the Machine Learning process and explains how the models work without getting too ""mathy."" There is some math at some parts, but hey, its ML and this was a great intro to the math and intuition of some important ML algorithms. One final reason to buy the book: I had trouble with some of the code in the book due to unknowingly having outdated versions of the necessary packages, so I emailed Steve directly, half expecting to never get a response. However, Steve responded with a very detailed explanation and code to help me get my code running. It was great. Buy this book if you want to learn how to work through Data Science Projects in Python."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked this book better because it broke through some other books' lectures and abstracts and dove into the kind of data and scenarios that  I am more likely to actually encounter in my job, rather than just memorize them. Plus I didn't have to fix or workaround outdated or outversioned python code as I have had to do with some online teaching forums. This book will move your career or business forward."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Data science is not a simple subject, but this book did not clarify or illuminate anything further for me. It may work for individuals with extensive background in statistics, but other works seem to be more clearly written. If you must use this, supplement heavily with online tutorials."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Written in a very understandable fashion. Takes the reader through real life data problems in useful ways.

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is great because it explains concepts well and uses real-world examples. However, the only machine learning free part was the first chapter.I would recommend this book to someone who would like learn about machine learning, not data analysis or visualization."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The book was pretty good in general, I liked the detailed work done in all the process from exploratory data analysis to the creation and evaluation of the different models created in the book. Also, I believe the explanation on how the different model work with scikit-learn was pretty good. I would like it to include unsupervised methods as k-means as well, but in general a solid book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to understand for beginners or anyone at any level wants to refresh on ML. I would highly recommend for data analysts and aspiring data scientists
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book for newbies to machine learning. You will get more from the book if you have a some knowledge of python.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clear and concise introduction to ML. If you don’t have a background in data science, I wouldn’t let this stop you from picking up this book. My own expertise is in mobile web development, which is outside the scope of this book title, but I had no problems going through it."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book covers basic concepts too ... and hence it is more understandable. I had Bishop before, but this book is better."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After I read this thread [...], I decide to buy this MLAPP.  I am not working closely on machine learning, but I use machine learning techniques frequently in my research. The review is partial, because I only carefully read some independent parts.When decide to buy this book. I care about and expect to obtain information on 1) the appropriateness of when I choose a machine learning method for a task; 2)  the big picture of whole machine learning techniques; 3) the intuition of important techniques explained without jargons, and 4) how are these techniques connected;Additionally, as an English as a second language (ESL) user, I expect the text is well organised and is written without ambiguity.From my partial reading (mainly section 16.6 and some random stuff), I would say the book indeed covers many popular techniques (topic models, deep learnings). The author also did a very good job in describing terminologies and giving succinct descriptions about the key part and the application of each method. These are the two features I like most.However, the downsides are 1) it is too abstract for some method descriptions that I need to leverage external materials (e.g. the original paper) to understand the method. Even though the description in the book covers the most important part, it is not sufficient and I would like to see more details. One example is in equation 16.105, why P_b(X) is not explained?2) The text is like an oral presentation in a very long tutorial intended to cover an index of techniques. Overall, its readability (text in Section 16.6) dispoints me. I know English is not my native language. But I would still argue for this issue. Previous I read some chapters in Bishop's PRML and the lecture notes of machine learning in coursera, they do better jobs."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,great condition
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A clear and concise overview of Machine Learning. I always wondered how AI could determine so many of our wants and desires before we knew them ourselves. Turns out it's all based on probability. What we want is based on how we match up with what others want. If a person likes or buys A, B, and C then we are offered what others desired after they also bought A, B and C. Now I know why some of the suggestions are spot on and others are completely off. The more you hew to the ""normal"" the better your recommendations will meet your expectations. Machine Learning tends to standardize our likes and dislikes, reinforcing our already formulated ideas."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very nice and gentle introduction into the field of Machine Learning. It will open up your mind and desire to get started into a more serious journey to learning about ML at a more deeper level.  The book will not bore you with the mathematical foundations of ML, but it will leave you with the desire to get you to explore more about this interesting field where data, math and computing all come together. I really liked this book."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Machine Learning is a challenging subject to understand. I bought this book because it seemed to have concise overview and hoped it would add to my motivation to learn the subject. However, the book is boring and uninspiring. It’s full of general commentary and devoid of memorable examples or visuals. A difficult read. Here is an example of useless observation in the book that does not add to understanding the subject and makes it overly philosophical - “machine learning, and prediction, is possible because world has regularities.”"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an excellently written book about a relatively new concept utilizing Artificial Intelligence to program machines for the purpose of doing something that would be in the realm of a human activity, actually introducing the concept of learning done on the part of a machine, how it is done, it's capabilities, limitations, challenges to mankind, machine learning"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good introduction to machine learning. However, if you are looking how to construct your own ML algorithms, you will need to turn to the online community. This book was created to give you a general overview of ML."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Although compact in size, this book provides a comprehensive and pleasantly deep and authoritative panorama of the current status of machine learning."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Phenomenal book. The author does a great job of making complicated concepts simple. One criticism is the author writes a lot in passive voice. However, the book does a great job of explaining machine learning."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an excellent introduction to machine learning for anyone but will likely be more satisfying for those who may be familiar with computer programming and basic statics.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,It is a good read for those who want to get a quick idea about all the attention that has given to machine learning and Al.  But of course you will need more serious and in-depth books than this if you are serious about learning the topic.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A brief, but useful, volume.  It could have been a little more detailed, in my opinion.  This is good for beginners."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is not written for a beginner or even an intermediate researcher.  This is a very serious book on Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.  If you are looking for computer code you can lift and use in your home grown system, this is not in the book for you.  If you have not had some serious math courses beyond the basics.  You will quickly be lost.  I have had 15 graduate math and statistics classes and work in IT currently.  I purchased this book to help me with a research project I am doing on my own with pattern recognition where machine learning is important to the process.  Many of my own equations as I did my research appeared in this book.  I am using a relational database to store information and remember patterns.  If you don't have experience with numerical methods and turning equations in to computer code and can do it in your head.  You will have great deal of difficulty with this book.  That said as a warning, now to the book.  It is a great reference and spends a great deal of time several statistical theories and their practical uses in signal and pattern recognition.  It also has various ways for doing curve fitting and dealing with weighted neural networks.  While this is written as a text book, it is more of reference book.  I do not see how even a years course could work on all the information in this book.  One of my chief pet peeves is that text book publishers have websites and answers only professors can get to.  How about those of us who are finished with school and have no intention of ever going back?  So to the publisher Springer I give one star and zero if I could!  This is a reference book and most likely will never be a text book. This is true with this book.  Which is why I rate it four instead of five stars because of the publisher."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great book, i recommend."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,Informative but horribly presented
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me be very honest: If  you don't have a strong maths background as is expected from serious researchers in Electrical Engineering or Computer Science, you may NOT find this book useful. I don't think this book should be tried by undergraduates except may be those who are in their final semester. The key aspect of this book is its intuition, that kind of draws a clear picture of what the complex equations mean. In no way,by itself, is Machine Learning an easy topic. So I don't think there is a book that may be so easy to follow and would also offer excellent grasp of the topic. But if you really want to learn ML, this book is certainly sufficient to take care of all the requirements. It is SIMPLY AMAZING compared to some other 'classic texts' that I bought."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The author does a good job explaining a difficult topic.  To be specific, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning is HEAVILY RELATED to the following fields of study (Optimization, Linear Programming, Signal Processing, Statistical Regression, Image Processing, among others).  I have taken many graduate level courses in these other subjects and this book compliments them well.  That being said, other friends that are new to the field find it very difficult to learn from this book.  My suggestion is to look up Stephen Boyd's YouTube lectures from Standford as a primer for your class.  Linear Algebra and iterative methods are good to know before reading this book."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This book (PRML) should be re-titled as ""PRML: a bayesian approach"". Yes, bayesian approach is very useful for machine learning, and sometimes the final goal of learning is to maximize some sort of posterior probability. However, if the author is such a huge fun of bayes statistics, please tell perspective readers in a clear way. Emphasize bayes aspects too much really hurt the quality of this book as a general-purpose textbook of machine learning.For a better textbook of machine learning, I recommend:1) The elements of statistical learning (perhaps this book a little hard for beginner in this field -- but as least better than PRML -- you can compare their chapters about linear regression to see which one is better).2) Pattern classification (focus on classification, not regression. Also not very easy -- anyway, machine learning is not an easy field ^_^).3) Machine Learning (a little old, but great for beginner.)These three book also mention bayesian statistics, but in a proper way. If you have some experience in machine learning and have engineering-level math background, just choose the 1) or 2). If you are completely a beginner, first take a glance on 3), and then go to 1) or 2).Finally, if you want a book that discusses machine learning purely from bayesian perspective, PRML is good."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this book and refer to it quite a bit.  Pretty much all the background material one needs is in there.  However, the book is a bit advanced for an initial exposure to the material, and the perspective is very strongly Bayesian.  This means some some difficult concepts are introduced early on.  The presentation of the EM algorithm in general (and Gaussian mixture models in particular) is one of the best I've seen."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best text books covering probabilistic background of learning in deep. Especially a good premier for one working on new algorithms and theoretical improvements. A good starting point for Bayesian learning.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This new book by Chris Bishop covers most areas of pattern recognition quite exhaustively. The author is an expert, this is evidenced by the excellent insights he gives into the complex math behind the machine learning algorithms. I have worked for quite some time with neural networks and have had coursework in linear algebra, probability and regression analysis, and found some of the stuff in the book quite illuminating.But that said, I must point out that the book is very math heavy. Inspite of my considerable background in the area of neural networks and statistics, I still was struggling with the equations. This is certainly not the book that can teach one things from the ground up, and thats why I would give it only 3 stars. I am new to kernels, and I am finding the relevant chapters difficult and confusing. This book wont be very useful if all you want to do is write machine learning code. The intended audience for this book I guess are PhD students/researchers who are working with the math related aspects of machine learning. Undergraduates or people with little exposure to machine learning will have a hard time with this book. But that said, time spent in struggling with the contents of this book will certainly pay-off, not instantly though."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of my top references along with The Elements of Statistical Learning and Kevin Murphy's book.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems          This is one of the best books you can get for someone who is just starting out in ML, in its libraries such as Tensorflow, It covers the basics very good. As a book, it is 5/5Once you are done with this book, the ideal next step is the ""Deep Learning Book By Ian Goodfellow"".Sadly my copy didn't look so good, If it were an under 300 book, I would have let it slide but when the book costs 1450 (Which it is totally worth it) I expected a much better copy."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is a very good start for software and engineering professionals who need to broaden and upgrade their skills in Machine Learning. It covers a broad range of topics, starting from linear regression and up to Recurrent Neural networks. I like the structure of each chapter - a relatively independent unit, offering the necessary mathematical concepts, software, analysis of the results and finally the relevant reference research papers.A very useful supplement is the book web site, given on page VIII of the book. The examples are comprehensive and the author placed additional information which otherwise can not fit in a book - e.g. the review of the YOLO to detect bounding boxes and detailed installation instructions. The presented examples take into consideration also the performance of the machine learning systems - it demonstrates several CNN implementations with Caffe in C++ and YOLOv3 in C.I certainly think that this is one of the books any machine learning practitioner would like to have on his bookshelf."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Example/code presented in the book is not compatible with latest release of the tensorflow. Reader will have to make the program work after lot of debugging and searching on net, hence can be sometimes very frustrating. Started with few chapters, but had to leave it in the middle because of this issue. But serves as a good starting point in terms of theoretical aspects on neural networks (cnn, rnn).At the same time I was unable to find a book dedicated on deep learning with tensorflow. Not a bad book at all, but incompatible with latest version of tensorflow. Can be used as a reference for learning/ understanding cnns, rnn etc."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quick glance shows that subject covered is done with just the right amount of focus on basics vs hands-on ML.Quite simply written and not intimidating at all. For those looking for a very deep look into the basics and the math background of the concepts should probably check out Duke University’s machine learning mastery with excel - which is a rigorous crash course on the very basics of the math.The problem with book quality on amazon is hit or miss. Paper that it’s published on is slightly cheap quality.Looks like also someone has used the book. That may be a concern to some people.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor publication for Indians. Graphs are printed in Black and White making it quire hard to make observations. Packing was poor as well. Not worthy of Rs. 1500. Try to get the original one and one which is published by SPD. Really very disappointed.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,This book is probably the best introduction for Machine Learning frameworks for some looking to apply it in their daily work or just as a hobby. Its not an academic textbook at all as focus on proofs and theory is left for exploration. Its  mostly a guided tour with important things to remember about each ML algorithm.The addition of exercises at the end of each chapter is a welcome feature as it really tests your understanding. If you are familiar with Python then this is probably the first ML book to learn. Good luck!NOTE ON INDIAN EDITION: The printing quality is abysmal and really disappointing. Color printing would have been very useful as most of the charts are comparisons and would help in visualizing tuning of hyperparameters etc. Get the US edition if you can spare the change.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Tha book is all what one needs to be confident to pursue analytics journey.Having spent years in the analytics industry, I find the book good for a person with some elementary know how of Machine learning like regression, Decision Trees.Part 1 of the book is good for beginners to make their knowledge concrete on the basiscs of Machine learning algos.Part 2 is more advanced stuff and talks about Neural nets ( different types) and dee learning.One gets to do analysis on datasets with codes , to get the right feel of an analytics project.A good book for anyone looking to get ahead.."

I bought this assuming it is the original color print imported from O'REILLY, USA. (To really appreciate the graphics,charts,graphs,plots, etc, you need to view in color). But this book does not look like original. Paying Rs. 3309 is worthless for this black and white print. You get SPD publication of the same book for Indian continent for Rs 1400."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is an excellent source of knowledge. I had only heard of machine learning in the past but never had good understanding of how it works. This book helped me getting a detailed view of machine learning from it’s early days to its status quo maturity as of today by co-relating to real life use cases. The book has very good description of how machine learning works and how it will be prudent in enhancing human life.   Besides this, there is very detailed elaboration of various machine learning softwares i.e. numpy, sklearn, matplotlib and python with pandas module for giving readers the better understanding on how to start working with machine learning. The detailed steps given right from basic setup of pydev in Eclipse, export of python library helps beginners have a very clear and  easy to follow reference at hands for quick kickstart.  The sample projects and python scripts along with reference websites provided in the book are very helpful in getting started with machine learning concepts.  I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and felt like reading through a masterpiece and symphony of information after long time."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The content of this book is outstanding, considered by many to be the bible of AI textbooks. Incredible clarity and easy to read.  Both Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell are icons of this field.  Anything else I could add in this respect has already been said in countless other positive reviews.On content alone, I would easily give the book 5 stars.  However, I have three criticisms regarding issues which markedly affect the ""usability"" of the book and hence reduce the rating:1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words.  In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics.  This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc.  Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book.  For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.3) The physical quality of this book is dismal.  The cover is thin/flimsy.  The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue.  Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc.  The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this.  When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy).  In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with. I know there's a balance here, of not pushing the price up, and not making a long book too heavy or too thick, but this is by far the poorest quality text book on my shelves, which at the price is rather galling.Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field.  At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this.  At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.Note: My comments refer to Pearson New International Edition - 3rd edition ISBN-10: 1292024208,  ISBN-13: 978-1292024202."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle Edition has serious issues where it renders mathematical symbols such as x and y as a tiny dot. This makes a hard topic nearly impossible to follow.(I'm willing to buy the paperback instead, but would like to keep the Kindle as an searchable index)"
,2.0 out of 5 stars,The book refer to Appendixes that do not exist. Also it refers to pages that do not contain information it claims to have. For example on page 245 it refers me to page 1066 for BNF. However if you go to page 1066 you find Bibliography. So I believe the book is incomplete as Appendixes are not included.

I come from an R background, but found the Python code easy to follow (use of many familiar data frame concepts)."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,It doesn't present you multiple point of view which is necessary to prove certain things. At some places data is interpreted to come to a pre decided conclusion and also in many cases data is assumed.Definitely a good read especially for men.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Eine sehr gute Behandlung der kernel-basierten Lernverfahren. Die Autoren bemühen sich, dem Leser stets den roten Faden aufzuzeigen. Die Kapitel sind mehr oder weniger eigenständig gehalten, wobei manches Resultat wiederholt wird. Dadurch ist es aber möglich, dass man auch springen kann.Die Erklärungen versuchen die Intuition anzusprechen, aber die Sachverhalte werden auch mathematisch hergeleitet."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was written by two of the kernel machine pioneers. It's a very good introductory monolog on kernel methods and an excellent reference book for anyone who wants to learn the fundamentals behind the kernel tricks and their applications.One may need an intermediate level of mathematics and linear algebra to understand the derivations and kernel designing ideas.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is dedicated almost entirely to support vector machines for pattern recognition. This is not really an introductory text to machine learning though. For that I would recommend Statistical Learning Theory by Vapnik or Neural Networks and Learning Machines by Haykin. However, this book is starting to get a little bit dated as the field continues to push forward.This book presents a very deep mathematics to backup the theory of SVMs. This includes reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces,  functional analysis and probability. If you are not familiar with these concepts already, you probably are not ready for this book.The appendices are great references, assuming you already have the necessary background."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I especially like the one class SVM algorithm invented by the author so I studied about two-thirds of the book very diligently. The math behind is a bit hard but still digestible. Strongly recommend for those who enjoy math and machine learning.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"To start with, this book is rather technical with many theorems, assumptions, lengthy discussions. At the same time, it allows a beginner to start with some chapters and start exploring this field - from understanding point of view and even practical aspects. That was the case for me, started with suggested sections, i understood why this or that theorem is essential and what is the reasoning behind.I find this book rather deep in learning with kernels and i suggest it as a reading for starting phD (and master?) students to get in grasp with concepts. And then delve into more details.The book itself is nicely organized by topics and is not at all to be read chapter by chapter. Authors give some guidelines what to start according to your prior knowledge or experience.I take one star off to show that ""may be"" there was a way to write about the same complex and fast developing domain better and easier to grasp for a reader :)"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfied
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book wanted to be the comprehensive discussion about SVM and related topics, but reality kicked in, and many topics had to be left out. What is here, though, is a thorough coverage of the most important areas. The authors do note at the beginning of each chapter which sections are essential, and which can be omitted at first reading. If you want to know about any specific area of SVM, it is probably here, and covered in depth. The authors are acknowledged experts in the field, and it shows.I started out dabbling with SVM, and turned to this book when I really needed to know what was going on. I found everything that I needed, and much more. Having a Ph.D. in mathematics helped with that side of the text, but found myself a bit overwhelmed with the statistics, a field that has numerous technical terms. The appendix on stats was insufficient. And learning theory was completely new to me. But as it turned out, neither was essential to understanding the rest of the book. The book has numerous examples, and the real learning happens there. I had fun reading the book, but my idea of fun is something most people would away from, screaming.The book has a gigantic bibliography, and the authors constantly refer to it. If you want to explore further in any particular direction, you will know where to start looking.There are a few typos, as can be expected in a book this large, and one theorem that is false as stated. (Theorem 4.1 needs the hypothesis of convexity added.) But the theorem is never actually used; it is just an illustration. One thing that I would have liked is some Web site for the book where these things can be brought up."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is the best book on kernel methods. It covers a wide range of subjects.The best thing is that after finishing one or two basic chapters, you can read the rest of the book in any order; most chapters are almost independent to each other. At the beginning of a chapter, the authors list the prerequistites, so a reader knows whether he will be able to understand the chapter.For now the book still reflects the state of art. But it is a fast changing field. I hope the authors will update the book in the future."

It does, however, have some holes; for example, it doesn't even mention SVM regressors.  If you have a class which assigns this and the Bishop book, sorry, you have to get both, because the Bishop book doesn't make any sense if you don't know ML, but this does.If this is now a back edition and you just want to learn ML by yourself, this is the book you want.The included E-Book is unusable though."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is well written and provides great exercises, but I feel that the description that its for beginner to intermediate programmers is a bit misleading.  I am a true beginner in Javascript, having used it for a variety of beginner projects, but I found the book to be too advanced for me.  I did enjoy the parts I understood, and I can tell its a good workbook.  I have to admit that I really knew I was biting off more than I could chew with this book, but, I was so intrigued by the concept that I couldn't help myself.  That being said, if you're a beginner I'd recommend that wait until you are more intermediate.  I'll be coming back to this book later."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is easy to read and follow the examples. I have not noticed when I received the book but it requires some coding background. I think the skill level needs to be around the upper intermediate level.Although I am a little more than beginner level in python I could comprehend the examples and easily follow the book but if there is no background in coding this book might be a little too advance for the reader.I have not completed the book yet due to my own research but I believe this book will help me to gain new perspectives. I highly recommend to those who has interest in machine learning.

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I managed to struggle through the first 3 chapters of the book.  Like other reviewers, I expected a much higher standard of writing from a book published by MIT.  My 1 star rating is based on the expectation I would have of a college-based publishing company.My main complaint is that the book fails to describe what 'machine learning' actually is.  Chapters 2 and 3 give a rather meandering overview of  standard multivariate modelling but doesn't explain what is involved in moving from these techniques to a 'learning model'. The author talks about the models learning, but never describes what this means in practice.  So I am left wondering whether ""machine learning"" is just another term for iterative modelling or whether there is actually something more to it.The book fails to meet the requirements of all audiences.  So someone unfamiliar with statistics, it would be a difficult read and not provide any insight into how machine learning operates.  For people are are familiar with statistics, it still doesn't give any insight into the value or point of using machine learning."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is badly written. Unless you are in an organized course and only just using this book as a reference with supplemental material, do not use this to get an understanding of Machine Learning. It'll be a huge mistake. Look around for other books with content that is organized cleanly from the outset with good practical examples. Reading this book feels like running around in a circle with my tracks being erased behind me. No offense to the author, but I am quite annoyed after expending significant time on the book and gaining little in return."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have read many textbooks in the field of machine learning, and I really don't believe that PRML is so-called the most classical textbook in this field. This book is very unreadable and annoying, and I often cannot understand what the author is talking about. It should be listed to be a reference, not a textbook, since most of the classical results can be found here. But if you want to first study machine learning, it will become a big disaster.I recommend ""Elements of Statistical Learning"" for advanced readers. There are many easier textbooks for beginners to catch the ideas of various algorithms, e.g. ""Machine Learning: The Art and Science"", Mitchell's ""machine learning"". Also some introductory books to R or Python could be also good for beginners."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a graduate student in computer science and I bought this book for machine learning and data mining course. This is a good book for both starter and professionals. The idea stream is clearly presented and examples are nice. Easy to understand.But one thing I don't like about this book is that the author used mathematical notations carelessly. For example, lower case function p() represents pdf or/and pmf while capital P() represent the probability. The author didn't separate this. Another problem is that a lot of unnecessary mathematical notations were introduced such that at the end of each chapter I always had to go back to the begining to figure out what those notations mean.But anyway, this is a really nice book for machine learning, I would definitely recommend this book."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this book as it was prescribed as course text book for ML class. I am writing this review on the last day of the semester & that this book was hard to read/understand. Most of the times author assumes that you already know most of the things. Also chapters on graphical models can be better found in other book by Koller (which is an amazing read). I won't recommend this text to anyone interested in learning this subject, it will simply kill your interest & make it dull & boring."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have two machine learning books currently; this book and the one by Prince on Computer Vision. I purchased Prince first, and followed up with this book, since in some ways I found Prince lacking some details and found some of his explanations difficult to follow (forward-backward algorithm for example), but overall was is good book and worth getting. I think in someways these two books are good compliments to each other. Prince focus heavily on application and sets up the problem, but does not necessarily tell you how to solve the problems (at least to the satisfaction of someone new to the topic like me). Bishop on the other hand does go through a lot of the details left out in Prince, but lacks examples to reinforce why I would even care about some of the topics covered. For example, I eventually skipped chapter 10 (approximate inference) after not seeing any immediate application for such an abstract topic.So back to why I am only giving this book only 3 stars. While Bishop does go through much of the math required to solve these types of problems, I ultimately find many of his explanations not very good. As one other reviewer pointed out, he has plenty of figures, but seldom do I think they provide much insight to what he is trying to explain. Case in point figure 11.1 is nothing more than two squiggly lines showing p(z) and f(z), one of which is an arbitrary probability density function and an arbitrary functional mapping of z. I think that by the time most people get being able to understand the material presented up to this point, they don't need this kind of figure. There are a few others, that while not as useless as this, could use a bit more description or clarification. Otherwise these figures are nothing more than squiggly lines.There are many topics here that I was hoping to learn from. For example, I had never learned anything on neural nets, and there is a whole chapter dedicated to that topic here. Unfortunately, I think the only thing that I can remember from this topic is that there different layers to the net, and I think in the process of him solving the equations of the neural net was ultimately using reverse auto-differentiation, but he even had some other goofy name for it (I think it was backward propagation). Another topic I was hoping to learn from was on support vector machines. I think this suffers from getting so buried in how to solve the problem, that even his examples show fairly complex decision boundaries (Figure 7.2, for example where he doesn't call out on the graph as showing what is what).And another issue with this is that the book has an appendix which describes the datasets used to generate many of the plots. However, if you go to the URL, the datasets are not there. Granted, the book was published in 2006, so certainly his website could have changed. It just is difficult to try and duplicate his methods to understand what he might ultimately be trying to say here.All in all, the book isn't bad. I think it works better as someone who already has an application in mind (and which method to use) but needs to be walked through the math to get an answer. After reading this book, I still wouldn't know which technique to use to get an answer to a problem that I have. Prince at least gives some applications and was a really interesting book.Update 9/22/16:I maybe was overly hard with my original review, however I will not be updating my star rating which I will explain why shortly. I read another machine learning book after this one ( Barber's Baysian Reasoning and Machine Learning). Overall, that other book is worthy of a 5 star review for learning the basics. After reading that book, which gives plenty of examples and clear explanations, this book does read a lot better. As I originally thought, this book does fill a good role as a book on how to solve problems, but not necessarily as a great starting place for those new to Machine Learning. Check out Barber's book for free from his website, and you will see what I mean."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not easy for a student with no experience on Machine Learning before. It might be useful for those researchers who have seen a lot. Many ""straightfoward"" or ""easy to show"" questions are not easy for me at a first glance. Many discussions are left to numerous papers, which does not make problem more clear but more puzzled. Many many comments are made in a very high level without detailed explanation. Most exercises are only algebra and  matrix theory, nothing to do with Algorithm. I have to read other books first."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only read through page 50, but I have already found several errors.  A particularly egregious one occurs in the first code listing, in which a regression model is fit through the origin even though an intercept should clearly be present.  The data for the regression model is created as follows:  two predictors, let's say x1 and x2, are created from the uniform(0, 1) distribution.  The response = 0.4 x1 + 0.6 x2 + error, where the error term is also distributed as uniform(0, 1).  That being the case, the intercept should be close to 0.5, the mean of the uniform(0, 1) distribution.  You may wonder what difference that makes.  Well... if the correct model is used, the model coefficients end up being close to the actual coefficients used to create the data, namely 0.4 and 0.6, instead of 0.7658 and 1.1252 as shown in the text.  In addition, R-squared for the correct model is about 0.3, a far cry from the ""high"" value of 0.893 reported by the authors."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After completing a couple of video courses online, I bought this book to reinforce my Python/FastAPI know-how. The book is in three core sections. The first two interested me the most. I love the pragmatic approach and pace, with enough detail to get going or gain a refresher in section 1 and deeper dives in section 2, providing all the core foundations., and section 3 building on top with the data science stuff such as NumPy, pandas and machine learning models. A great book to have as a companion when working with FastAPI."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bueno, digamos que si llegaste a este libro buscando un libro de FastAPI aplicado a machine learning y data science... vas simplemente a encontrar un libro de FastAPI. Y punto.De 12 capítulos, 11 son de fastapi, 1 de numpy y pandas, y todos empiezan por una introducción. Incluidos los dos primeros, que te introducirán a Python mismo, y a gestionar entornos virtuales con Python.Por lo que si ya tienes un cierto nivel y buscabas, como yo, un libro ESPECIALIZADO, este no es tu libro. Si no has pasado del tutorial de FastAPI, entonces sí, es tu libro ideal.Siendo honesto, los ejemplos están muy bien, hay a patadas, y te introduce a todas las características que hacen a FastAPI uno de los mejores frameworks para el desarrollo de APIs. Incluye una profunda introducción a fastAPI, pydantic, ORMs como tortoise, etc, y la introducción de numpy y pandas es muy amena y positiva.Pero, y de ahí mis dos estrellas, ni el título ni el preludio dicen eso! Te esperas un libro ya orientado a un perfil más directo, con muchísimo más contenido de data science y ML, pero ni por esas. No hay nada de gestión de paquetes scipy, ni conda, ni muchos otros conceptos que buscarías en un libro con este título.Decepcionante, una verdadera pena."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Imagine a world where…· Your phone is too big for your hand.· Your doctor prescribes a drug that is wrong for your body.· In a car accident, you are 47% more likely to be injured.If any of that sounds familiar, chances are you’re a woman.Almost all of recorded history fails to mention women’s role in humanity’s evolution. Instead, the lives of men have been taken to represent those of humans overall. This has created a huge gender data gap in the representation of the other half of humanity. The modern world is riddled with elements designed with little to no consideration for women.In Invisible Women, Perez brings together an impressive range of case studies, stories and new research from across the world that illustrate the hidden ways in which women are forgotten, and the profound impact this has on us all.She presents the jaw dropping reality of a society that is systemically ignoring half the population. City planning, economic policies, technology, medical research, tax structures – they are all defined by the absence of data for women and have thus, inevitably, been designed for men.The shocking gender bias revealed here will make you look at the world from an entirely new perspective. You will clench your fists in anger and want to fight back. The facts are alarming and thought provoking.A book such as this should be mandatory reading for everyone, irrespective of gender or area of expertise. If you read only one book in your lifetime, choose this. Read it and recommend it to everyone you know. I do mean E.V.E.R.Y.O.N.E."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is thorough in informing us about all the spheres(which is all spheres) of life where women are ignored, or considered as smaller sized men or just treated as deviations from the normal.From as trivial as snow-shoveling schedule to as pressing as sexual assault on women, there’s jarring gender data gap everywhere.The hope is to let women be present in all institutions who could tackle not only the gender data gap but also begin to design our society with half the population as *not* an anomaly."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Invisible Women exposes the gender data gap and as a consequence how the world is pervasively, but invisibly, biased against women. Reflecting on the book's contents will help uncover your unconscious bias and encourage you to actively seek out the voice of ""invisible women""."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First things first: the designer of this book was clearly on a roll. The font is clear and delightful. The italics, in particular, are so beautiful I had to take a picture of them and send it to my friend so he could appreciate them too. The cover design is subtle and fantastic. When you take the dustjacket off, the overlaid blue male figures disappear, leaving the invisible women behind, which ties in wonderfully with the book’s overarching message. The texture of the dustjacket and hardcover is delightful, with a velvety-smooth overlay that is really pleasing to the touch.The book is heavily referenced throughout with endnotes. These are collected directly after the acknowledgements, a full 69 pages of references. The impact of this collected body of commentary serves to underline the density of information and dedication of the research which went into this book. While I’m not a fan of endnotes, personally, the stylistic choice to collect them all together gives undeniable weight to the book, and makes it difficult to dismiss its conclusions.But that’s enough about the physical construction of this book (for which Chatto and Windus deserves great praise). What about the content itself?Well, I read this book with a combination of mounting horror, frustration, and rage. Criado Perez takes the reader by the hand and gently leads them along a journey of discrimination against women which is endemic in all areas of life. Split into six thematic sections (Daily Life, The Workplace, Design, Going to the Doctor, Public Life, and When it Goes Wrong), this book catalogues a pantheon of circumstances where what is female is considered as abnormal, as less than standard, as Other. Collected together, the ignorance of design to the differing needs of 50% of the population is both fascinating and incredibly infuriating.Criado Perez doesn’t use this book as a stick with which to beat the patriarchy, however. Rather, she delicately unpicks the circumstances which lead to a lack of consideration of the needs of those other than what is considered to be the default. Her examples are wide-ranging, touching on every area of life, and consistently return the same conclusion: women just haven’t been thought about. It’s not that their needs have been considered and dismissed. It’s that the fact that they might have different needs hasn’t even occurred to the people creating these structures.(Generally. There are some notable exceptions. One quote from Tim Schalk really burned my cookies. But it’s not actually the norm.)From Sheryl Sandberg’s explanation at Google that heavily pregnant women can’t walk long distances to Apple Health’s omission of allowing tracking of a menstrual cycle, for many examples in this book, the reason for these omissions is that people didn’t even think of them as a potential need. Cars are crash tested rigorously before making it to market – but the dummies used are 1.7m tall. This is the size of the average man, not the size of the average person, and it leads to shocking statistics like the fact that women – despite being less likely to crash – if they are involved in a crash, are 47% more likely to be seriously injured. Criado Perez points out myriad ways that this unthinking acceptance of male as default – and as applicable to all – unfairly impacts on women, and leads to their being unconsidered in further development.The book has one overarching message, which calls clearly from every page. Do something about this. Don’t accept data as applicable to all. Sex-disaggregate data, and investigate how men and women are differently impacted. In an era which relies on big data more than ever, the gender data gap needs to be acknowledged, counteracted, and filled. And it needs to be done with a specific focus on counteracting the detriment which the gender data gap had caused. Otherwise we end up with situations where a policy designed to create more family-friendly situations actually end up disadvantaging those it intended to help.Criado Perez is not myopic in her discussions either – she skillfully acknowledges the intersections of race, gender identity, disability, and other minority identities can have to create a cumulatively detrimental effect. Invisible Women is a primer on how not to design, a feminist manifesto, a fantastic example of hard research with incredible readability, and a thoroughly engaging experience. It has filled me with rage and frustration – my friends and family have borne the brunt of several rants already – and I’ll be passing it on and recommending it to pretty much everyone I know."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this book intending it to be a gift for a family member.  We have a shared interest in statistics and this seemed like a good punt.  Unfortunately it will not be passed on.Firstly the positives:The author is clearly very passionate about her field and has put together a truly awe inspiring set of statistics that completely support the stance that women are biased against in society.  This clearly needs to change, and there are some very good examples of where this could be done easily and effectively.  It has been an eye opener to me to consider some of the examples brought up, crash test dummies, drug testing and outdated sexist guidance in a number of areas.The negatives:There is a consistent pattern of stating a set of statistics, and then expressing an opinion that this is an example of gender bias which could be fixed with gender disaggregated data.  On a first read the conclusions, which seem consistently that men make decisions and that those decisions are implicitly designed to make women worse off off, are not entirely supportable by the statistics gathered.As an example, snow sweeping - which is carried out by clearing the main roads first and then minor roads.  The statement made is that this is biased against women as this benefits those commuting by car (men) and harms (physically) those who travel on minor roads as pedestrian (women).  The conclusion that data should have been gathered which included more women to prevent this bad decision.Firstly, it could be plausible that the decision makers - being commuters by car themselves - might have made a decision based upon their experience.  This is in and off itself is decoupled from gender. One could imagine a mixed panel of working men and working women making the same poor decision with equal gender representation.Secondly, the bias that exists seems to be that men benefit more from the status quo than women due to the nature of the jobs they do (paid work, full time, greater male proportion).  The imbalance here is not how streets are cleared but who the jobs are carried out by - so addressing gender bias via the job market would be a better path to removing the gender bias without addressing the poor decision making of how to clear snow.Thirdly, if one were to gather gender dis-aggregated data this might incentivise equal gender participation. However, this does not guarantee that the set of people involved were from different selection groups and might still exclude those ""people"" that do not commute via main roads.  I am sure plenty of women also benefited from the 'main road first' approach - so one could imagine a poll of opinions which covers 50/50 by gender but excludes non-commuters.All of the above are independent on what the best way to clear snow is and what we even mean by ""best"" in this context (cheapest for execution, reducing road accidents, reducing hospital attendance).I've already fixated on this one example too much, there are others but if you have read this far I risk boring you too much.  The issues raised in the book could probably more accurately be expressed as a journey into poor decision making by excluding groups given selection bias.  The biases are not specifically gender and do not generally indicate a bias against women (there are other biases and poor decision making at play that predominantly harm women as a side effect) - although there are also examples of terrible bias that deserve to be considered - crash test dummies for everyone please!!I think the author sets off with an axe to grind, and spends the book grinding it.  If you are feminist or pro-equality with a view that the world is biased there will be a lot to enjoy here.  If you attack it objectively there are still some gems with regards to systemic bias but there are plenty of opinions that do not bear up to analysis.Overall a good book (I think), just lacking a level of objective scientific rigor that would have made it's message more convincing."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is amazing at opening the door on invisible bias, unfortunately I am not a fan of the writing style.The author makes fantastic points backs it up with great facts but then in an attempt to cement her point she will suddenly and needlessly jump to unrelated examples of sexism e.g. she makes fantastic eye opening points on why women's toilets should be bigger than men's but then jumps from discussing women's needs and toilet requirements in the West to toilet issues faced by women in India (this just belittles her first point).She also uses the term 'White Men' a lot, I really cannot stand generalisations but stuck with it. The author seems blame all the issues faced by women on men but reading this book makes you think a lot of these issues are a product of their time and are now a systematic societal issue which is as much women's fault as men's; for example 76% of teachers are women and women by far make up the majority of childcare, so why/how are children still being raised with a male gender bias? We have everything we need to change it so why hasn't it been changed? the reason is because the women themselves (and men) don't know issues exist, both genders need educating on these issues.Everyone should read this book as it provides great insight into bias we cannot see but live with but I think blaming one gender for the issues faced by another will create division and stall progression."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Firstly, this is a great read.  The reader is taken on a tour of an unknown yet familiar world as the author lays out the facts and costs of the gender data gap. You can't get accurate answers if you don't have quality data- or if you don't ask the right questions in the first place.  This isn't presented as a conspiracy against women but as the result of just not seeing slightly more than half the population in the data. The results can range from the inconvenient (not being able to access tall shelves or straps on the Underground) to the fatal (women and men react differently to drugs but mostly only male data is recorded.) The most common reaction to these problems where they are recognised is to try and ""fix"" women to be more like men (suggesting voice coaching for women to use voice recognition software that responds to male voices). This is a valuable and useful book. Please buy one for the engineer in your life."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only gone through the first 4 chapters till now, but I can already say that I feel a lot more confident about my deep learning knowledge. I had some theoretical knowledge of machine learning and deep learning but unfortunately never got the opportunity to work on a ML project at university and starting out something new on your own can be intimidating. This book has helped me get started and is proving to be a very helpful guide. The corresponding Github  repo and the detailed explanations of the code and the underlying concepts is exactly what a beginner like me needs. Would definitely recommend it."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the book because Amazon said it's great for beginners, and I will have to agree. For a beginner to get a hang of the huge world of AI and deep learning, this book acts as a brilliant start. It not only has a good amount of technical knowledge embedded into it, but also helps you to get started on the practical aspects of deep learning. In fact, after reading it, the real value turned out to be how fast it turns a beginner mindset to think like an experienced practitioner. “How did Google solve this”, “how did Facebook scale that”, “How much did it cost”, “How fast could it get” etc. You would find most of the projects mentioned in the book as a Colab file which you yourself can pick up, tweak, and run. From TensorFlow to CoreML, you can find projects encompassing and using both of these platforms. Coming to the projects, it has simple projects starting from a basic cat detector to the more complex projects like starting on your own autonomous racing car and AI-based search engine. Also, it’s been useful for me to reverse engineer systems and try to build a similar system at my workplace. In fact, the advanced facts appealed to me the most and I was able to utilize those learnings at my work."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a frontend engineer, not an artificial intelligence person, never studied it but it's become quite the rage and in office, managers are always on a lookout for terms like “Deep Learning” and so I thought of trying it out. I looked up a couple of books that taught the theory but they are difficult to read, I don't have a mathematical background. So those weren't helpful.Eventually, I found my way to this book which as it says provides relatable examples of daily industry products along with code on what to do and how to do it. This is useful because I can at least run existing code immediately and figure out the rest. It also gives case studies which were helpful in seeing applications of ML. Another reason why I like this book is because the authors don't throw theorems, code and facts at you, instead the tone in the book is helpful and like a guidance counselor they show you how to go from idea to implementation. The book has significantly increased my interest in ML because from a practical standpoint it's easy to navigate. As a frontend person, tensorflow.js and ml5.js turned out to be very relevant. At the office there is a monthly seminar where people talk about some new ideas. I showed one of my pet AI projects and that has helped me gain acceptance and credibility in a new field. If you are looking to try something new and learn about ML - this is hands down the book for you."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"IMO this book reaches the whole spectrum of audiences from beginners to experts alike. As a Machine Learning practitioner of 10+ years, I found the content on optimizing deep learning models for low-cost edge devices very relevant and useful. The book succinctly conveys all the important trade-offs in artificial intelligence that one would encounter in day-to-day practice. It is based on industry-based projects and covers all the important theoretical concepts along with directly runnable code-snippets. Overall in this day and age, this book has the potential to train and prepare an entire generation of people for the oncoming disruption of AI across all sectors of society."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"TLDR; Best book to understand and use Deep Learning in the industry. This book provides a bridge between what’s taught in courses and what is actually done in the industry.I was just finishing my Junior year with a lot of theoretical knowledge of Deep Learning but not enough practical experience to showcase this during interviews. Most resources on the internet only gave a theoretical understanding through equations, whereas this book has been completely practical and goal-oriented since its first page. This book does an amazing job at telling you what exactly you need in order to deploy your model, scale it further and analyze its performance as it grows.Each chapter becomes a separate project by itself on different areas in Deep Learning. The authors also made this book extremely beginner-friendly and easy to understand such that implementing and testing every concept was not half as complex as it was in theory. There are cheatsheets present at every chapter providing tips and techniques for every situation an ML Engineer building AI for an edge device might find themselves in. After an in-depth explanation of a certain process/concept in every chapter, there is also a Case Studies section about the same concept being deployed in a popular Silicon Valley startup / a tech giant with an explanation about how this concept works in the company’s use-case.My favorite chapters were those on building our own Self Driving car and Building an Autonomous Car using Reinforcement Learning with AWS DeepRacer. These chapters gave me clear insight into how AI works in the field of Self Driving Vehicles and also pointed me towards implementing them.The book teaches you how to work with all the state-of-the-art libraries, and tools such as TensorFlow, Keras, TFLite for Android, CoreML for iPhone, and more, suited for edge devices.The information on making full use of edge devices up giving me a huge boost in interviews and subsequent interviews too. 10/10 would recommend if you’re looking to apply all the theory you’ve learned from courses into real life."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My team and I were attending a huge ML hackathon, and we had an amazing idea that we were looking to train and deploy on a phone.  All of us knew how to build and train the model roughly, but none of us knew how to deploy it on a phone.Looked around for several resources that could help us out and we realized there were PLENTY of resources that talked about DL theory and code but none about how to actually put it into action until we discovered this book.The book is about results from the get-go, and it does a great job of telling you exactly what you need to know to deploy your DL model. It does this without boring you with hand-wavy equations and theory, by making every chapter a full-fledged project, where they cover the different techniques. They also have some really cool tips and tricks on how to improve DL performance since we're focused on devices with low computation. It's absolutely beginner-friendly as well.My favorite chapter was the one about building a Shazam for food. It was a great real-world application of ML instead of just building a digit-recognizer that we're never going to use in real life. The book also makes sure to teach you how to work with all the state-of-the-art libraries, and tools such as TensorFlow, Keras, TFLite for Android, CoreML for iPhone, and so on.As for the title, this book helped us win the hackathon with a massive cash prize. Invest your money in this book instead of Tesla stocks for more guaranteed returns!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,It has turned out to be an excellent book for a beginner like me who didn't know much about deep learning.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good book. Easy to understand. Provide hands-on projects as well
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing this book after reading the first 14 chapters out of a total of 17 chapters. I had a good experience with ML and DL through online websites such as coursera, udemy and my undergrad projects. But I never worked to bring my deep learning model from jupyter notebook to real-world application. I am currently pursuing my Master's in AI in agriculture science at Virginia Tech USA.  As a part of my research, I have to build real-world deep learning applications. I was looking for a book which can build my foundation to deploy the models for a real-world scenario. This book bridged the gap between my theoretical knowledge and practical use. This book even helped me to write a research proposal and this research proposal got accepted by my university committee for financial support. I feel whether you are a beginner, average or experienced, you must go through this book if you are looking for a book which can help you to learn the techniques for building robust and efficient Ai apps. This book shows you the path to improve speed and accuracy as well as scaling to millions of users. With 30+ case studies and industry examples, you will become confident in solving any kind of industry problem. This book also focuses on Responsible AI. Some of the chapters that helped me are : Real time object classification on iOS, developing android apps with tensorflow lite,  maximizing speed and accuracy of tensorflow ( a handy checklist).  I highly recommend you to read this book if you are looking to solve and deploy real-world AI problems."

I found it annoying to wade through what seemed like jumbles of ideas lumped together in paragraphs. Simple ideas are drawn out over long stretches of text and the style of writing is just strange in places."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great reference for machine learning.  There are many figures and the treatment is clear and comprehensive.To my knowledge, it is the best treatment available.  It's not a perfect treatment, but at this stage in the field's development, there is no such thing.  Very good for a 2001 book."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bishop's book about machine learing and pattern recognition is well written and the figures are really pretty because they are in color and informative. Overall the book looks very nice and it is fun to read in. In my opinion only the book 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' by Hastie et al. looks comparably well.The book is a textbook rather than a monograph and, hence, intended for students rather than researchers and the coverage of machine learning topics is thorough without being able to cover every topic in deepth. This is not really a draw back because no book is able to do this anyway. The presentation of the methods is informative and, depending on the background of the reader, clear enough to figure out how it works to use the method.What is the problem: I do not like that the methods are introduced not rigourously but by examples. That mean Bishop does not have the definiton, theorem, proof style but is more heuristic. This may sound very helpful for the reader not familiar with the topic to reduce the barrier of understanding by providing examples to visulalize the problem. The problem is, in my opinion, that this is not the case but the oposite. In think it is never wrong to provide examples and it is absolutely desirable but after the examples are given and one has an intuitive understanding of the problem one wants to see its formal solution because that's what machine learning is about, it is applied statistics. For this reason I give only 4 instead of 5 points (but not less because also all the other books about this topic fail in this respect).Overall, the book is well done and certainly a good source of information for students and researches."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Most disappointing. Does not deserve even one star ! I do not know anybody who can program and who cannot understand a mathematical equation. Surely, if one can understand or write alpha and delta in a Python equation, does know his/her (math or Greek) symbols. Here you have a book which introduces a matrix in Chapter 3 (p41 - a list of vectors is called a matrix) and then gives you an example in Chapter 6 (p103). In between, you multiply matrices using Python language, of course without understanding what exactly you are multiplying ! . On page 233, you have ""a vector is a one-dmensional tensor. A matrix is a two-dimensional tensor, and higher dimensions are referred to as n-dimensional tensors."" A dictionary could not have been more explicit in circular explanation. And all this is supposed to be for people who just still remember their high school math !In my opinion, the book would have been better with each chapter including some maths - as an appendix or otherwise, followed by the why and the Python code. As it is, all the book shows that the author can write Python code.The only good advice I have taken from this book is on page 295: ""Start another deep learning course"" and ""Grab a mathy deep learning textbook"". Very expensive advice, I would say, given the price of the book.I bought this book following the good reviews on Amazon, on the undertanding of the title ""Grokking..."" but I am most disappointed with the book contents.Not even worth a star !"

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite having a mathematical background (and having grokked many concepts of DL) I found this book insightful.On some shortcomings:I agree with some of the other reviewers that, having mastered the maths of DL, this approach might rather confuse. Maybe math is the simplest language in this regard. Personally I found a few points more distracting than this, specifically the backpropagation for the NN for sigmoids in chapter 11 (an approximation is used which is never explained) and the batch gradient descent in chapter 8 (just wrong). A minor point: Personally I prefer PEP8 coding standard, the code is also a bit unique and sometimes hard to read.On its strengths:This book invites to deal with DL deeply, try out for yourself, to learn from your mistakes (and maybe deliberately from shortcomings in the explanations). This is sometimes painful, yet this is the way you learn. Specifically the strongest points are the step-by-step explanations (e.g. backprop) where each step is executed ""on paper"". I very much liked the part on Autograd. Having Worked with PyTorch and TF for years I took many things for granted which, surprisingly, I really never understood. Building a framework step by step from ground up helped me a lot. An other great point are the many tips throughout the book (sometimes well hidden), which are also worded so that they invite deeper understanding (and more research into the topic).Overall (for me) the strong points outweigh the shortcomings by a wide margin."

Die Seiten sind nicht zentriert, sondern viel zu weit oben angelegt (siehe Fotos).Außerdem sind rechts und links nicht dieselben Abstände zum Seitenrand.

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Califico el libro en función a su calidad física. Tenía dudas si comprarlo o si comprar la cuarta edición porque leí opiniones que indicaban que estos libros tenían mala calidad de impresión, a algunos que les faltaban hojas o les venían en blanco, otros que les faltaban los apéndices, etc. La cuarta edición me parecía muy cara y encima con riesgos, así que me decidí a comprar esta versión. El libro dándole un vistazo a primera vista no tiene las tapas del revés, ni le faltan apéndices, ni le faltan hojas o vienen en blanco, tampoco las páginas son tan finas como alguno comenta, están bien, y la tinta está bien definida. En mi caso el problema es que la impresión está movida hacia arriba, pero muy movida, no llega a salirse fuera de la hoja pero por poco, por arriba tiene un margen de 6 milimetros, y por abajo de 4 centímetros y 4 milímetros. Parece un libro con la impresión defectuosa, de echo, es el primer libro en mi vida que veo con la impresión de esa forma, tengo unos cuantos libros en mi estantería y nunca había visto uno así.El problema es que yo este libro lo compré para tener una versión elegante para colocar en la estantería y poder consultarlo en formato papel si en un momento dado lo necesito, pero el libro no es elegante, no se lo voy a poder enseñar a nadie, de echo parece defectuoso."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It was my first book on Artificial Intelligence.I'm myself not a computer scientist by training, but rather work on a somewhat adjoint field of statistics and computer modelling of dynamical systems. Given that, the book was very accessible for me. If you're OK with the Bayes theorem and the normal distribution, you'll probably have all the mathematical background which is needed to understand the mathematical side of the book.Classical problems of AI such as decision making, search, prediction, filtering are described in depth. Several dimensions of each problem is discussed, such as: computational costs, the history of the problem (which I often found nearly more inspirational than the main narrative), applicability of different solutions depending on the real world constraints, etc."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As someone who frequently attempts to adapt existing research for real-world use cases, I often find myself in situations where I understand how a model works, but I’m not sure about how to implement it and train it efficiently. Usually, I look to stackoverflow, GitHub issues and medium tutorials, but the ideas contained in them are often fragmented and obsolete. However, this book provides an in-depth and up-to-date explanation about how to implement various models, right from the libraries and pipelines for data processing, to data visualisation methods to understand predictions. The resolution of ambiguities re. TF1 and TF2 that is repeatedly emphasised in the code  examples (eg : when and how to use @tf.function decorators, enabling and disabling eager execution for debugging etc.) is quite useful as well.Additionally, Chapter 11 and 12, on how to integrate Keras/TF and CoreML to build deep learning applications on iOS is extremely well written and helpful, especially given the lack of end-to-end online tutorials for miniaturising machine learning systems to run on phones. Particularly appreciate the section on how to build the iOS app and the complete CameraApp implementation on the book's GitHub repo; its much appreciated that the authors don't presume knowledge of Swift app development on the part of the reader, and provide supplementary material and code.Also, love the fact that the tone of the book is generally light and humorous (see the ‘An Apology’ note in particular)"

Chapter 1 to Chapter 7 helped a lot in gaining intuition about the model.The authors described topics from basic things - when and how to choose transfer learning, understanding the CNN model to advanced topics - simulating a self-driving car and building an autonomous Car using AWS DeepRacer. The authors provided the code for reference too.The book described deploying models in the cloud provided an understanding of how things work and how to build the models to work seamlessly on the cloud and build web-based models efficiently.The chapters on building mobile applications are helpful to deploy models on mobile devices. They covered the architectures and frameworks used and their working simply. The section 'self-evolving model' is very captivating.And the final chapters on simulating a self-driving car using  AirSim and building an autonomous Car using AWS DeepRacer contains cool content.

This was not my first introduction to AI but I liked how practical the approach was and that they provided reusable code in github which was very useful.

While I was wondering how to optimize the deep learning model computation, I've come across a TensorFlow User Group Summit keynote session by the author in which he explained techniques to improve training and inference. Based on that, I got to see the book which contains details in more depth. I'd say this book is a weapon for anyone who's looking to build deep learning models for edge devices or planning to deploy their model on the cloud with less latency. Also, the authors were kind enough to respond to queries and guidance on the path to getting better at deep learning. I should also mention the image search optimization techniques that are said in this book are pretty useful.If you are the one who loves to scale your deep learning model while not losing much accuracy or generalization capabilities, this is the book for you."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The brilliance in this book is that Criado Perez presents multiple examples of a blatant male bias in the aggregate data being used to make decisions that affect women and men and leaves it sitting there for all to see that acceptance of the status quo is untenable, for any progressive and healthy society. There is no man-bashing here, thankfully. On the contrary, Caroline states that this gender bias is not malicious, it is and always has been unintentional, but it does disadvantage women in terms of vehicle safety, healthcare, and in myriad other ways. As a parent of three girls and two boys, several of whom are pursuing careers in STEM, this text is incredibly relevant to us. I could waffle on about the ways that this bias exists and that my offspring have encountered ad nauseam, from lab coats and goggles in only male sizes to consultants that think girls only exist to make coffee and look pretty. Enlightening, fascinating and mind-blowing data presented in an engaging and entertaining format - a very worthy 5 stars!I saw Caroline being interviewed at the Edinburgh book festival recently and was impressed by her candour about the online threats she has received simply by putting her head above the parapet to campaign to have just one woman represented on the new bank notes and also by her reticence in being perceived as a strident feminist. What she has written here is simply a factual representation but it has brought her into the line of fire from all kinds of misogynists and people who would wish to silence the voice of truth and reason. These entrenched biases are not going to be corrected overnight, despite how detrimental some of them are to us as women, but the more of us who tentatively stand up and say 'actually, we matter as well' then perhaps the more likely we are to finally be heard. Although in the current political climate - terrifyingly - the reverse might be true."

We all found it biased, tedious, one-sided, and generally without a balanced view of the topics covered. Some conclusions were just plain preposterous, ridiculous and sometimes funny e.g. bricks being made smaller to fit women’s hands. There were some nuggets in there around women’s health and safety issues, but they were almost lost in the mountain of stats, bias (ironically) and negative rhetoric. The tone was at times desperate, aggressive, hurried and it provoked anger amongst some of our members. Would not recommend to anyone."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,This book was a complete disappointment. No insight provided beyond what is already known. The main purpose of the book appears to be how many times can you use / repeat the tag line ‘gender data gap’ before the reader wants to burn it. The determination to coin the phrase completely distracts from anything else of meaning. Such an irritant.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Das Buch gibt einen tiefen Einblick in eine strukturelle Ungleichheit zwischen Mann und Frau, ich denke jeder hat die ein oder andere Person aus dem Umfeld im Kopf, von dem er sich erhoffen würde, dieses Buch zu lesen.Damit komme ich jedoch zu meinem größten Kritikpunkt: Ich denke nicht, dass dieses Buch Menschen von einer gegenteiligen Meinung überzeugen kann, wenn die- oder derjenige nicht eine gewisse Affinität zur Aussage dieses Buchs hat. Grund hierfür ist der Ton des Buchs. Allzu oft wird eklig in Richtung ""Männer"" allgemein geschossen. Das wirkt übermäßig voreingenommen und nervig. Ich hätte mir den ein oder anderen Seitenhieb weniger gewünscht, um größere Neutralität auszustrahlen. Neutral betrachtet ist die Situation in diesem Buch korrekt abgebildet, nur leider geschieht es nicht in einem neutralen Ton. Das schränkt die Zahl der zu erreichenden Lesen meiner Einschätzung nach sehr ein."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"An important, insightful book that everyone should make an effort to read, exposing, largely successfully, how 50% of the world's population is ignored in data modelling.However, it does need to be read critically, with each aspect weighed and measured in your own scales. Some of the evidence doesn't support the thesis, some has alternative interpretations, some is from obviously not-very-objective sources, and in some cases we are being asked to replace the default male bias with an alternative female bias. I would repeat that these instances are exceptions, not the rule, but neverthless you will want to read it slowly and carefully."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,classical book for  ML intro
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"As a professor who have taught machine learning at the graduate level, I found this book one of the worst ever written for machine learning.Put simply, it obfuscates things rather than explaining them. It made machine learning look unnecessarily complicated, and yet ugly.Extremely wordy, and lacks organization.There is too much ""boring"" equations and not enough ""cool math"" (geometric intuitions). And while most people found it too ""theoretical"", I found it not solid in theory at all. Some important theoretical topics are left out, such as perceptron convergence proof (which can be explained very easily using geometric terms) and theory behind KKT conditions (which also can be explained geometrically).Also there is an almost ""religious"" tendency towards Bayesian, and almost every chapter ends with Bayesian. While bayesian is very useful in some subfields of machine learning, it is not a universal magic across all machine learning.Definitely not a textbook for beginners or a university-level class."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this book about 10 days ago and I am over half way gone already, even in the midst of my full time work. I couldn't go a day without reading this book. The style in which the explanations are delivered is next to none. What a great book.It is definitely worth reading for anyone trying to understand the concept of Deep Learning. The fact that the underlying Calculus is almost non-existent, but uses simple explanations and forces one to get their hands dirty with code, is just the perfect way to learn. One thing I found really good was that, every time a new  concept was introduced,  it almost always felt like the authors anticipated my next questions, and always provided the answers. It was so so easy to read and follow along, without having to google for better understanding.Overall, I highly recommend this book if you are looking for somewhere to start."

The code examples are also clear and easy enough to follow. Overall, I would say the book is really good and I would recommend it as reading material for machine learning degree courses; as it would have been more helpful than some of the materials I had to read on my course."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don’t buy this book. The content is super light, dangerously so. I love Manning Publications, but this book was a huge disappointment. Instead buy “Practical Data Science with R” 2nd ed. for guidance on AI techniques and “R for Data Science” for tidyverse guidance."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the book for which I was finding from the last six months.It expertly introduces transformers and mentors the reader for building innovative deep neural network architectures for NLP.The book covers almost all game-changing applications for natural language processing (NLP), natural language understanting (NLU), and natural laguage generation (NLG).The book is very useful even for beginners in the domain as the questions of each chapter are answered in the Appendix."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a wonderful, plain-English discussion of the mechanics that go on under the hood of neural networks - from data flow to updating of weights. Specifically written without a slant on normally-wonky math, the concepts are presented and then advanced at a digestable pace for anyone. It makes for a wonderful textbook for a course, and should be required reading for product managers or marketing people getting into deep learning, alike."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It has nothing but some different flavors of ""hello world"" transformer codes. Not good for beginners or experts.  Writing is pathetic."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is well written, between the code examples, and the graphics. I appreciated the various applications and variations of the original Transformers presented in the book. I found that dedicating, quite quickly, only the first chapter to the building blocks theory may be too little, and the theory is a bit too rushed. While I understand the goal is indeed to stay ""Applied"" early-on, theory is still important to nail down the understanding correctly. I'd have appreciated one more chapter on the theory (not necessarily more math/theory, but rather taking it slower) and one less chapter on yet another variant of BERT.Overall, great book to have in your bookshelf if you're into ML and NLP."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is a comprehensive reference on Transformers, the new technologies used in natural language processing. The book covers all the mathematics and architectures. It goes in details over HuggingFaces, Bert,  Roberta, GPT2 , GPT3, T5, and many more. It is recommended if you want to have an handson understanding on the technologies that took natural language processing by Storm and made things like CNN and ever Menon absolute obsolete. Very much liked chapter 4 with the challenges observed in modern nlp. definitely recommend the book. 5 Stars, also because updated to 2021."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"A well intended hands-on book for NLP enthusiasts; however, when it comes to explaining the core concepts the language barrier is quite evident and the explanations are brief. For example, the author mentions about paying extra focus on the chapter about transformers, which ironically is brief and difficult to digest without referring to the nice free-of-cost references listed at the end of the chapter and in the github notebooks. This holds for the following chapters as well. Additionally, there are quite a few errors in the text. A bit more proofreading is what one could expect for the price you pay.All in all a decent attempt with an overview of transformers, transformer-based architectures and its applications. However, if you are looking for step-by-step conceptual explanations about transformers and their variations this is NOT your go to reference. Personally, I would recommend Getting started with Google BERT by Sudharsan Ravichandiran. On the other hand, if you are is looking for clear steps to set up your first transformers notebook project, this could be a resource to refer to.On a totally different note, if still interested in the book, the publisher offers, both, print + ebook (immediate access) for a lower price of about 29 euros."

Bad sentences (talking about NLP), long explanations for trivial things, terrible explanations for key concepts, horrible ambiguous typesetting of formulas (ever heard of Latex, perhaps?). A total slob-job, not recommended."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This book, as many others about the ""NLP transformers revolution"", has almost no interest. It is just a collection of verbiage made upon easy notebooks reimplementing the typical Python snippets available freely on the HF and AllenNLP websites. It is almost a shame to see so many editors publishing such works which do not bring anything new about the subjects and at best reproduce the knowledge proposed for FREE on HF or AllenNLP websites. Let's take the example of Chapter 10 about QA. The author proposes to generate questions to be asked to the QA pretrained model. He is proposing to use NER for identifying entities in the text context and then writes a snippet to hardcode questions based on the entity categories.... OMG, it is not at all how we do such questions generation process with Transformers... If you want to start discussing how to generate questions from a context (and honestly I do not see the point here), at least use a Transformer model in an inverse close tasks manner. You will teach something new to your readers and keep credibility at the same time.So to summarize, do not waste your money with this kind of books pretending to teach you how to do NLP with Transformers. Plan 2 months of homework studying HF, Stanza and AllenNLP repo and watch the Stanford YouTube videos from Manning. Free and much much better."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great book for anyone new to the subject of deep learning applied to AI. The author goes to great lengths to explain each topic in sufficient detail to understand it. He then follows it up with a python program to illustrate the key aspect of the topic. The Transformers model is explained in detail with the simplified attention getting as their key to encoding  and decoding. BERT is then one of the metric programs often used for measuring the performance of the particular NLP app, Transformers in this case. The author goes further in explaining how Bert does it. This opens the door to using it for other mappings. Thus the book handles roBERTa, GLUE, SuperGlue and etc.The chapters on translations and generation are particularly interesting because it leads to a discussion of generation and GPT-2 and GPT-3. This is a topic that requires massive computing because of the number of words involved in their data, (540 M) and (1.75 Billions, 8 10000 PCs) respectively. Three of the later chapters are devoted to word extraction. The final three chapters are devoted to Language understanding.I have no hesitation in recommending this book to any student of modern AI."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The methodology for developing the deep networks and understanding them are there, but I hate that he uses a baseball team and figures out their chances of success by how many toes they have. It's ridiculous. I would rather see examples that make sense like the age of the players or something. The MIT course online uses the amount of time spent on a test, and number of lectures attended to figure out likely final test scores. So if you're the author, and you read my review. Please use less made up examples or examples that at least seem less made up. Thanks."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,Don't get his book unless you have a good understanding of NLP . If read  the book Getting Started with Google BERT first this book will make so much more sense. The two combined will leave you with a great understanding of transformers and the models that used them. Good examples there are a couple that don't work or require a lot of modifications to get working even in Colab. This is why I have given 4 stars if all the examples had worked or the author updates the code for chapter 6  and the one other chapter it would be a 5 star book.

Its a big ask tackled well by the three authors and various additional contributors, all of whom are vastly experienced and respected in their fields of interest. The book offers a fascinating and engaging read for those who are seeking rather more than a basic introduction to machine learning and applied data science whether from the point of view of a lay person, or like the reviewer, someone wishes to gain more than an appreciation of the field – an exposure to the actual nuts and bolts. This book succeeds from both approaches. For the first a wideranging account of existing and emerging techniques and tools available for various deep learning frameworks. For the second a closely integrated set of Jupyter Notebooks is made freely available. These notebooks, offer anyone with access to a web browser, the ability to carry out many of the examples written in Python with the libraries of the deep learning frameworks – such as TensorFlow and Keras. In a simple and straightforward way readers are enabled to carry out their own experimentation with the data made accessible by the authors. In other words the reader is able to DO machine learning, not just read about it!The authors have provided a good service to the public. The book is an authoritative introduction to the constituent fields of machine learning and provides an online experience for a number of recognisable groups: the software developer who might seek to develop skills applicable in the field of AI; the data scientist  to enrich their skill set and deepen knowledge of the field in order to build real projects; the student to assist in the aspiration to a career in AI through developing a portfolio of interesting projects and to help unleash creativity; the teacher since this book can supplement course work with fun real-world projects.

The book started with introducing readers to practical examples of how far Artificial Intelligence has come today, and then over the 600 pages recreated those examples in great detail. The authors have done a fantastic job explaining concepts in a fun way which are backed by real world scenarios and code (GIT repo) which readers can run themselves. That effectively meant just pressing the run button on Colab notebooks for TensorFlow and Keras code, instead of having to make any installations on my machine. This book is well structured, practical, easy to follow and makes a good attempt to keep the reader motivated from one chapter to the next. I can strongly recommend grabbing a copy today if you have any interest in learning how computer vision & deep learning projects are built at top companies."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would summarize this book as targeted ""guidance/help"" to speed up learning AI with heavy hands-on practical experience.My background is in the world of network engineering. I have previously attempted to pick deep learning with coursera courses but abandoned early when the calculus portion started. This text in contrast kept me far more engaged due to its approach. After reading the first three chapters, I could grasp the art of training convolutional neural networks for my own dataset - the inner workings of the layers, how to fine tune these layers and how to interpret results, find errors and improve. Transfer learning, Data Augmentation and many other topics are very well explained with proper examples in code related to the topic.  Similarly, instead of searching and reading hundreds of pages of documentation to understand - ""how to maximize the speed/performance"" - 40 pages of chapter-6 were more than enough to achieve this. Chapter-12 onwards gave a real deep dive into many interesting AI projects (including apps, robotics and even autonomous cars) - a real practical thrill for all levels of AI engineers.The practical approach really helped me to build a good understanding of the concepts of deep learning while coding in python using Keras and TensorFlow. At least now when I see a company release an AI product, I can make a decent guess about how I could go about building the same myself."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book gave words to my rage; a coherent argument to my thoughts; a spark to the fire within me that suffocates every day under the unyeilding breath of unpaid work.The chapter 'the drugs don't work' which details how the gender data gap is quite literally costing women their lives, is particularly galling, depressing and enraging.Every woman should read this book. Every man should read this book. I feel to carry it with me so that the next time a man manspains feminism to me or tries to tell me that true gender inequality exists only in other countries I can quote some statustics. Or, failing that I can throw the book at them. And after reading this, I really do feel like throwing something at someone."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is so important, everyone should read it! Not every woman, everyone! The books looks at the data gap relating to women (ie men make decisions and implement rules based on research made for/by men and that totally ignore the slightly different circumstances women may have, from public transport to safety, childcare needs to public toilets... you name it).The statistics and data the author has collected is simply shocking. Everything she quotes is referenced, you can look up every study she mentions. A warning though, if you're a woman, this book will most likely make your blood boil (I felt so cross with myself for not even questioning some of these things, for accepting what is clearly a design flaw as unavoidalble). I could only read a few pages at a time, which I then needed to digest, eg the fact that female police officers don't have stab vests that are designed for their bodies, the fact that the author received death and rape threats when she campaigned to have a woman featured on bank notes (perspective people? ), the fact that women do the bulk of caring for their children or eldery relatives but nothing is designed to help them (from public transport, to the order in which roads are cleared when there's snow...).This book is an eye opener and made me realise that the only way things can change is by women being more involved  (accepted? ) in the decision making and by studies being gender specific. But as women get death/rape threats when they raise their voices over something as trivial as a woman on a bank note, it's understandable that they're reluctant to do so."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I genuinely feel like this should be a book I would love. We unarguably live in a world dominated by men. And I don't mean that in the sense of a criticism, necessarily, but rather that fundamentally the design of our world centres around men in some part, from seat-belt safety to the way in which computer generated data analysis even works. Caroline Perez highlights some of the foundations of our society, some of the data bias but most importantly just some of the design flaws with society which are archaic and didn't, at the time of their design  and still don't, reflect a woman.If I think about even the language we use, we use terms such as ""mankind"" and ""man-made"" without even a nod to the women involved. Only recently did an emoji appear feminine, and actually when I think about it, most of the time when you look at a ""thing"" it has to have overtly feminine qualities or we just assume the thing is a man. How bizarre, but totally true.Nevertheless, I don't think that this book prompted me to think about these things. I think it certainly highlights a huge gap in our thinking, an entirely unfair and dated approach to a large number of life's routine components. But I don't think it challenges it, although of course that's what the book is for, but rather it feels like a commentary on stats and numbers and facts without really having a dialogue with the reader. I don't know, just something felt very ""textbook"" about it, whereas a lot of non-fiction with such incredible content feels much more accessible.  It's easy enough to read, but you notice the info-dump whereas in better delivered novels you don't notice.I completely appreciate what this novel is about and how important some of the information within it is. I would challenge anyone to read this and claim they came away having learned nothing. But the approach is a little heavy handed for me and I just didn't enjoy it; in fact, I preferred my time thinking about it myself far more."

XX and XY."" does not acknowledge that even sex (let alone gender) is much more complex in reality (see https://gimletmedia.com/shows/science-vs/j4hl23 for a different point of view on the topic).Consciously or unconsciously, statements like ""The result is that when ‘brilliance’ is considered a requirement for a job, what is really meant is ‘a penis’"" erase the struggles that transgender women face.I really liked the data that the book provides, but I find it hard to recommend reading this book without having to caution about the erasure of people lived experiences and struggles this book reinforces.I wish the author had incorporated caveats throughout the book to the fact that sex and gender are not a simple binary and that people that do not fit into the binary norm are suffering an even worse fate and that, in that regard, cis women hold a humongous amount of privilege compared to non-binary and trans people.That does not mean that a book like this should not be written, and, for the sake of making progress on these topics, it should be written, and I thank the author for that! We cannot solve all problems at once. But instead of erasing other underprivileged groups, the book could have acknowledged them and moved on while setting the scope of the book."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A thought provoking book that opened my eyes to some unexpected ways in which women are often unthinkingly discriminated against due to long accepted male norms in research and data gathering across a broad spectrum of life experiences.I do wish she’d given a shout out to Maya Dusenberry’s earlier book Doing Harm (on the narrower field of US medicine) as she seems to use a lot of the same examples here. It would also have been helpful to have a glossary of the numerous acronyms that pop up and sometimes a brief explanation of them e.g. AWS, rather than assuming the reader knows how they work. Some of the areas covered seemed a little trivial (I know lots of men who prefer the smaller iPhone se for example) whilst larger issues like women’s pension poverty and the recent addition of a year to their state pension age within 5 years of retirement in the UK were barely mentioned. This gender data gap is clearly meant to read as a universal problem but that also meant that the book spread itself a little thin at times using many US examples especially in medicine. On the whole good and highlighted areas I wouldn’t have thought of as impacting on women before; even though the final sections seemed to get a bit bogged down to me."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has to be a book everyone reads and is aware of. Really important information regarding the absence of women in so many realms of society. From using 'male' designed dummies when testing how the body reacts to ergonomics of a car when it crashes (more women die or are seriously injured) to drugs being tested on only men and as men and women's bodies are made very differently, sometimes these drugs either do not work on women or they have worrying effects. It shows how little effect the 'equality act' which I campaigned for in the 70's has had for women. Read ....and become aware."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved this book from start to finish - page after page of 'Oh, yes I'd noticed that, but didn't think to mention it to anyone, it's a man's world after all' to believing that finally folk have taken the time and trouble to research this stuff and then for the author to capture it all (well, a LOT of it) and present it in a totally accessible way. I work at Birmingham University (UK), and this will now be stocked in the main library. I have recommended it to EVERYONE, academics, friends,people on the bus, a friend who's recently become an MP (in the hope it might influence him some), since beginning to read it as I feel everyone SHOULD read it.A great book - enlightening, revealing, thought provoking - I'm not a feminist, but am seriously considering becoming one....fab read, can't recommend it highly enough - most enjoyable, wonderful...."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Whether you agree or not with her style, delivery or strong feminist outlook this book exposes very important facts we’ve overlooked before, in some cases life threatening, in other cases financially Unsubstantiated and yet it seems we’re missing a trick to solve so many world problems by overlooking 50% of humans. Amazing, eye opening and a must-read for all, especially if you can convince a man to read it, in particular men of influence.  She should have put it out in two versions, one as it is, another by a Pseudo male author with a title like ‘Are all humans male?’, then we might see some shifts in policy."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"In the final section of this book, Caroline Criado Perez notes that conflict, natural disasters and, yes pandemics exacerbate existing inequalities. It's something I thought about a lot as I read her well-argued (and extensively sourced) thesis, particularly its sections on work and the unpaid ""second shift"" in the home: how would the 2020-21 update of Invisible Women read? To what extent could we have avoided some of what we are facing now had we disaster planned around traditionally female jobs, caring responsibilities, education? Had we only collected the data?The one-word summary: this book is informative. At times it veers into into-dump territory - the Kindle edition is 55% text; 45% endnotes and indices.

The first chapters are supposed to get you going with Kubeflow but they leave a lot of blanks and a lot of things are not thoughtfully explained. I found a couple of blog posts that would introduce me to the topic better. The rest of the book reads more like a library’s documentation than a book. I guess I would have been better off to directly read the docs and do my own research. Thought this would allow me to get going with Kubeflow faster than browsing the web. In conclusion, it didn’t."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a fantastic book which explains how to implement various ML algorithms using. Every script in the book works like charm and it helped me understand some concepts of ML. The book is focused and appears to target people who want to work in ML without exposure to statistics and other fundamentals of ML. I would have been very happy if it had covered artificial neural networks in slightly more detail (how these networks are implemented) explaining the pseudo code. One of the biggest challenge in understanding ANN is how is it implemented. What flows from one layer to next. I would definitely recommend this book

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This book isn't really about machine learning. There is relatively little in the book about the machine learning algorithms themselves. Most of it is plumbing: how to munge the data in using R. And there are some nice motivating examples on using the ggplot2 library in R to visualise the results. (However, on the downside, plots which require colour to be understood are presented in black and white, which doesn't help! The R code mostly works, so usually it is possible to produce your own, but it seems a waste of paper to output plots that show male vs female dots, say, in different shades of grey on the same graph.)Also, when the algorithms are presented there are sometimes some serious errors (see the review on amazon's US site ""Erroneous but entertaining"" for more details). The single most shocking example was when a series of numbers was said to show the percentages of variation explained by an analysis, but the series added up to much than 100%. This was by no means the only error, however. The cumulative effect for me was that as I got further and further through the book, I began to have less and less trust in what was being presented to me.I would characterise the book as being for hackers in the sense that you are encouraged to try a technique and see if it works. One good point is that the book emphasises having a separate test set from your training set.Trying techniques until you find one that works is probably a good place to start, especially if your interest is in starting to learn the broader field of data science -- getting the data in, analysing it, visualising it -- rather than specialising in the selection and choice of machine learning algorithms themselves (for which Andrew Ng's coursera online course is a far better choice)."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have stepped into a new role at work with the need to become a practitioner of deep learning. I purchased this book to help me optimize some of the machine learning models I've been working with and to help drive knowledge with examples. This book has helped me accelerate this process in many ways. It teaches well with examples that play directly into my scenarios on iOS and Android. It has been useful already in several ways -- in particular, it has helped me to understand how to deal with an overfitting problem I have been dealing with. Thanks Anirudh and Meher!EDIT: Having spent a bit more time with the book, I can update the review with a bit more detail. This book is quite witty with many funny examples. Kudos to the authors for taking the time to be so inventive with their practical deep learning examples. This book has mentions of many interesting applications of machine learning on mobile and in other places. Some nice CoreML and python examples which came in quite handy."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As someone with prior theoritical knowledge of basics of Machine Learning techniques, I was looking for something that focuses on application and that I can readily use for my work. I recently had the need to add client side model for mobile app, and this book was right on the point for what I was seeking. I dived right into chapters 11 and after. The book adopts a very hands-on approach, and saved a lot of time for me. I eventually ended up reading most of the other chapters too as they were such a good refresher. I especially liked chapters on performance tuning for deep learning and the scalability aspects. Overall, I found this book a great read and would recommend for both new ML enthusiasts as well as other ML engineers."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Right from the outset, the friendly tone of this book yields a free flowing, friendly funnel to the advanced concepts the reader is trying to learn. With this friendly approach, the intimidation factor of difficult concepts like Deep Neural Networks become a little bit more human. It also helps that the examples they have selected, from the references to the HBO series 'Silicon Valley' and trying out 'Shazam' for food create a fun learning experience while diving in sufficient depth for any new ML engineer. I learnt a lot from this book, and intend to use this knowledge in my day-to-day. It also helps that some of the authors have done this in practice in the real world with groundbreaking apps like Seeing AI. Great writing and strongly recommended!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a recent high school graduate, going into my freshmen year of college, who is interested in getting into the field of Deep Learning and AI. I found this book to be an incredible resource for accelerating my progress in these fields.Going in with absolutely no prior experience, I read this book and was astounded by how much it taught me in just a couple of days / weeks. The clear syntax, understandable language, and engaging examples support an excellent entrance into fields of Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and AI by not only providing easily accessible opportunities for hands-on learning, but also explaining the importance of the book's content. This was incredibly important to me as someone who did not know much about Deep Learning prior to reading this book: the way Koul, Ganju, and Kasam wrote this book goes beyond informative - they inspire creativity and practicality in the future of what Deep Learning, etc. can do.Further, Practical Deep Learning also provides an excellent transition from ""I don't know anything"" to ""Wow! I am creating my own project... and understanding it!"" Thus, the detail and content of this book make it suitable for all levels. It's a truly fantastic buy for anyone interested in Deep Learning - especially for those on the outside who are intimidated, like I was, by the concept of this field!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently needed to brush up on machine learning for a new project at work (for background, I have been in the industry for close to 10 years writing software). I studied ML in school. but deep learning, which is the buzzword now, was new to me and I was looking for a book that's less focused on the mathematics, and more on the practical side. I was also looking for example code that's ready to use. Fortunately, I found this book which met both of my requirements.The authors did a great job explaining the important concepts of deep learning. I remembered it took me a while to understand and remember the concept of backpropagation when I first learned NN at school. The way they explained it, particularly the diagrams, was so clear and spot-on. Wish I had this book when I was a student.After reading the first four chapters, I was able to follow the simple steps and make an image classifier with high accuracy, which was what I needed for the project at work. I went a step further and also tried out the image recommendation system from chapter 4, which helped me in understanding image features in greater detail and how to scale it up for large datasets.I used to think it would take a long time for me to be able to apply deep learning at work because I was overwhelmed by questions like the framework I should use, the programming language, and where I can start collecting training data.. This book answered all my questions and provided just what I needed for me to get my work done. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be familiarized with deep learning and be able to start coding and shipping production-ready machine learning projects."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book gives a very good overview of machine learning and AI and how the revolution started! The comparison of different deep learning frameworks has been super helpful in making a decision on which one to pick based on the requirements. It is quite hands-on with code snippets being provided along with the theory. The book does a good job of explaining the tradeoffs between running the model on the cloud vs the mobile, which is very critical to understand while deciding model deployment strategies. I love the style in which it is written. The core concepts are introduced in a clear fashion, with witty jokes positioned appropriately.  This is a very useful book for someone not only starting in the field of AI but also someone who is actively developing AI-related products in big companies or startups. I have enjoyed reading it and it is a worthy purchase!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this book to supplement my studies in machine learning in college. Although I have only been studying ML for a semester, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which is a modern take on deep learning & artificial intelligence with lots of case studies and practical examples, along with a dash of humor on each page. Each chapter starts with a fun story and presents 3-4 ways of solving the same problem, along with pros/cons of each (like time to implement, scale, and performance) and software/hardware requirements. These solutions grow in the range of complexity gradually,  from more novice ‘student’ solutions to ‘industry’ solutions. Sometimes I could find my answer for my needs in the first few pages, but in other cases I read further to find a more efficient solution. Some tools even removed the need to code a solution, making it as easy as a mouse click, especially since all the code for each model is easily accessible online. The chapter ends usually feature performance benchmarks on different hardware as a ready reference (e.g. running 5 AI models on 6 years worth of iPhones), and case studies from different companies making the concepts taught very relatable. Good chunk of the chapters I read were implemented with Keras and TensorFlow for training, though it does go over nitty gritties of CoreML and TensorFlow Lite  Overall, this book was refreshing because it approached familiar problems from many different perspectives. I learned how to approach solving new problems in the most time and performance efficient way, and enjoyed widening my ML toolkit along the way."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is an excellent introduction to Deep Learning for those who want to start building effective Al systems immediately. At a time with many introductory books about deep learning, most texts only cover the theoretical background of neural networks. Instead, this book fills the gap between theory and practice with valuable information about the specific tools and techniques needed to develop a deep learning system.The book describes several software tools that are essential to get maximum accuracy from a machine learning pipeline such as Tensorboard, What-If tool, Keras Tuner, AutoAugment, AutoKeras. Subsequently, most chapters stress on concepts like latency, speed, battery life, scalability, resource utilization, etc., important concepts for most engineers in industry. Experiment after experiment helps develop intuition on why a particular method is fast, accurate, or cheaper. Practitioners inevitably learn these concepts over time, so becoming familiar with them early on, and having an available reference, will accelerate the development of your first few projects. Furthermore, even advanced techniques such as generative adversarial networks and reinforcement learning for autonomous cars are introduced in a very accessible manner. Understanding how they can be used will quickly advance the reader from a beginner to a practitioner.The book is quite large, with almost 600 pages of content, giving the reader much information to learn through multiple reads, and then later on the shelf for future reference. The reader will gain tons of value from having bookmarks throughout this book as they journey through building out real-world deep learning systems."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read this book after taking a basic Machine learning course in my school. The book was easy to follow and a natural next step for me. It covers both theoretical and practical Deep Learning and enable you to work on real-world problems which gets really exciting as you learn more concepts and gain experience with the tools. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to do hands on work with tensorflow and keras which is really the showstopper here. I don't own a gpu so training is sometimes difficult but this book had a solution to that too, they have the notebooks on google colab and github. I liked how francois chollet, jeremy howard etc shared their experiences, its unusual, but i’ll take it. The book also points to other resources like how to visualize a neural network which is a good guideline for future learning, and I plan to look into these later."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book will make you look at the world entirely differently. We hear “it’s a man’s world” but the irony is, it really is! Every single aspect of this world we women merely survive in rather than thrive in is designed and built by men for men. From small insignificant things to huge game-changers, women’s lives, from conception to grave, are made harder and therefore much worse than they should be for 51% of the world’s population.  This book opens your eyes to all this and more.  I really enjoyed it because it taught me that it was never me being weak, unfit or just abnormal when I struggled in life, but the fact that I have been fighting a losing battle trying to get along in a man’s world. So it made perfect sense to me and made me breathe a sigh of relief. But then I also got angry at the injustice of it all. All the lost potential to a world that actively excludes women from practically all walks or life. Men will benefit from reading this book too to understand women’s difficulties and how they can help be a voice for us to help level the playing field as rejoice in our differences not to simply ignore it as medicine, science, tech, the military and politics seems to do."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,A barrage of facts and insights on the “gender data gap” and the harmful effects of treating males - often 20-something 70 kilo white American males - as the default human.Well researched and cited.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Life-changing. It’s so good to have affirmed with hard facts what women around the world have known for years and live with daily. Women don’t factor in much of the decision-making that takes place in most industries and offices, including medicine, policing, public services and yet they account for half the population, pay taxes, vote.Caroline Criado Perez offers startling facts, cross-referenced to the hilt and it would be interesting to address now that Pandora’s box has been opened, what are the next steps to address imbalances on this scale?"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow this book is frustrating!  Oh, don’t get me wrong it’s mind-blowing, incredibly well-researched and brilliantly written. The frustrating aspect is how women are quite evidently seen as ‘niche’ and ‘atypical’ versus men despite being 50% of the population! The book tackles a myriad of subjects and expertly unpicks the dismissive thinking behind the ‘pink it and shrink it’ approach of catering to women. Highly recommended but don’t read it before bed as your heart rate will rocket and you’ll struggle to sleep!"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've read a few books recently which should be made space for in the 16-18 curriculum. This is a fascinating multi-disciplinary view of why women don't fit in the world and how we should change to make sure that they do.So many examples of discrimination, thoughtlessness, lack of intellectual rigour, unscientific approaches, etc. There is some irritating repetition - I did occasionally say ""I get it!"" and want to move on.An education programme built around this book could open the eyes of so many young people, particularly making young men understand better the reason that many women feel that the world often isn't a comfortable place for them."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes for this book when I bought it, however I found I couldn’t get through it. The writing style was dense with statistics and information which was a little boring - I would have preferred it to have been broken up with some of the author’s opinions/stories. I ended up stopping reading about a third of the way through. However if you don’t mind a lot of facts, it definitely is an interesting read. Of course I didn’t finish it, but of what I read I felt it could have provided more of an analysis around transgender women as the author seemed to completely equate sex with gender. Overall, though, I don’t doubt it was a good book - just not the right style for me."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The book provides examples in a wide range of circumstances where decisions are taken or conclusions drawn on the basis of inadequate information because data is inadequate, based as it is on only masculine views and perceptions. Caroline Criado Perez makes her points forcibly and tellingly. It is impossible to disagree with the conclusion that far more must be done to disaggregate data, and to get away from the male-dominated views of the world. The book is a somewhat dense and demanding read, but one can only admire the tenacity of the author in pursuing her case over such a wide range."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely amazing. I’d read lots of good things about this book so borrowed using the library ebook service. Was so good I’ve had to buy a copy as I can imagine I’ll re-read it. I’ve already recommended it to others and lent it to a friend. I’m not a non-fiction fan but it’s easy to read. It really makes you think and while it’s obviously feminist, it’s not man-hating. It’s very objective. My father was really interested in the bits I read to him. More men need to read it to have their eyes opened. A must read for all girls/women even if just to educate you in looking out for your health. (As well as loads more) Caroline Criado Perez also does a regular newsletter via email which is brilliant too."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm someone who agrees that men and women should be equal and I really dislike books on feminism that are written to put men down or blame them for current sexism. I'm also a data nerd, I love books that can back up their theories or opinions with stats and make some assumptions about what these stats are saying by looking elsewhere or using previously found knowledge.Caroline absolutely smashes this book, she makes it clear to start that whilst she's pointing out clear discrimination against women using stats, a lot of this has been done unconsciously and because of culture norms (i.e. an office environment is very different for a women in 2021 than in 1970). However, what she does point out is that by using the data we have and challenging norms we can have some incredible positive impacts on women's lives. The biggest issue is that a lot of companies and organisations don't collect data nor split it by sex which ends up meaning that we continuously accidentally discriminate against women. BUT if we become aware we may be doing this we can do something about it.The examples brought up in the book are extremely well thought through. The only issue is that, because there's a lack of data in some places, she jumps from different regions to use the available data. Sometimes this can be a tenuous link with the point she's trying to make. Having said that, an absolutely incredible book that every senior leader at every single company should be reading."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely one of the best books I have read in a long time. I am not sure why some are saying it comes across as aggressive. I didnt find that myself at all, I think the aggressive perception has more to do with the reader than the style the book is written in. The chapters on medical bias are extremely good and something I have a long personal experience off. I have recommended this to every man and woman I know. Women don't always believe or really understand the bias we face because it is our normal and we just accept it as how it is. If men approach this with an open mind and not from defensive position I think they would get alot out of reading it."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my initial report from spending one full day with a single chapter of the softcover version of the book. In my daily job, I am a manager who decided to enter the field and understand better the scientists I am hiring and thos who are working for me. I actually wanted to start with the Mock exam which strangely enough appears at the end of the book and not at the start, but maybe the intention was to do the mock exam after a reader finished the book?!  Eventually, I jumped to the chapter on Bayesian Machine learning. Yes, as the author describes, some of the questions are VERY difficult (at least for me), BUT the fact that he carefully clarifies with the solutions-manual and illustrations extensively helped my understanding. I think, the author also managed to cover a wide variety of topics while still connecting them to one another and giving interesting real-life examples and implementations in PyTorch and CPP. The fact that the index is very extensive and easy to use is just the cherry on the top!I promise to update my review again when I finish the chapter."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It's hard to figure out who would actually benefit from this book - it amounts to seven hundred pages of equations interrupted by blocks of text that fail to provide any intuition whatever for the techniques they are describing, and the occasional graph which is remarkable in the universe of graphs as being scarcely more informative than the equations it is meant to illustrate.Seriously, you have to wonder wtf Bishop thought he was doing here.  As a catalog of equations for people who already thoroughly understand the learning algorithms I suppose the book can be considered adequate.  For any didactic purpose you're wasting your time - you can find dense, technically correct but incomprehensible descriptions for any of these methods online, for free.  A textbook ought to aspire to more - should bring some order to the chaos, re-tell a technical story in a new light to make it more sensible and intuitive.  This book is so bad in these regards that it makes me angry.On a related note, I can't believe that Duda and Hart is still the best machine learning / pattern rec. book on the market after thirty years or whatever.  This field is dying for a book by someone with even an INKLING of how to teach, or at least willing to make an effort to try."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This book spends pages upon pages redundantly explaining the theoretical and mathematical aspects of ML, but gives very little effort in getting deep into the ""coding"" side. It just gives you the code and never explains what each statement is supposed to do, why the parameters to a function/method are chosen that way and what they do etc. It just gives you the code to mug up. Sorry. Don't waste money on this."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,I find it very informative for a person who is non-stats background and non-programming background. It does not teach A-Z of Machine Learning but gives a good insight into the ML and application of ML. The book had tried to explain ML in a basic common language so that it can be understood by every common guy.After reading you will be an intermediate level guy in Machine Learning. Worth Reading
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant book. Best for learning R and machine learning.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent book to understand the concepts and algorithms of Machine Learning using R. I feel this is the best book start with.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Although should be called an Introduction to Machine Learning with R, this really is an very well, gentle introduction to the core Machine Learning techniques and methods with R. Its offers just the right level of information to understand the principle, without getting bogged down in the maths that typical machine learning texts do.  I have a collection of ML books(bogged down in excessive maths) to get to understand some of the core algorithms, so getting into a bit of application helps motivate.  Unlike many R machine learning books, this text still offers some relevant insight into the algorithms, rather than hit the reader with a rather tedious install package, call function blah, and here are the results, that several texts suffer from. One weakness, is that a data scientist would spend a lot of time data preparation and processing, before being able to apply ML techniques, and this text somewhat glosses over that stage, for the sake of getting into the interesting applications.If you have adopted R to get into Machine Learning, I would highly recommend this book. Which can then be followed by the deeper ""Applied Predictive Modelling"" by Kuhn and ""Elements of Statistical Learning"" Hastie  texts with perhaps some support and perhaps from the R in Action books."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Struggling to get to grips with coding in R, let alone Machine Learning - but this book covers both well.  Worked examples are very useful.  Sets out to give you a foundation to build from.  I'd agree with that.  I am more comfortable with the processes and helpful intros to different packages to use in this.  This can accompany a more rigorous ML text, and would advise that, but this really opens your eyes in the how to do it, hands on.  Was initially hesitant to get this given numerous books out there.  But glad I did."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this book based on great reviews from others. However, this book really disappoints. For an illustrative guide, it doesn't really have that many illustrations. And the illustrations it does have are neither innovative nor on target for illustrating the most important aspects of neural networks. It is definitely NOT a book to learn neural networks. This book maybe appropriate for a layman who wants to read a novel about neural networks. Even at this, I find the book quite boring."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is excellent for the beginner, intermediate, and advanced programmer. I used this book as a compliment to Jon's deep learning course back in 2018. And a year later, I still go back to it for a refresher. Page 91 is definitely my favorite page of the book. wx = b. remember that equation and remember it well. Jon is an excellent lecturer and this book is a great representation of the theory behind deep learning and Jon creates a tremendous source for all levels to enjoy!If you're a beginner, don't be afraid of deep learning!!! I wrote my first hello word function about 6 months before I started reading Jon's material. I was able to even create my own small project as well!I highly recommend this book to all!"

I already have bought a bunch of references mentioned in the book.  I have a concrete project I want to work on and  I needed a quick overview what is possible. This book gave me exactly what I needed.I liked the style of the chapters with the summary and the ever growing list of key concepts.Great buy."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had my doubts that a book about deep learning that doesn't contain rigorous mathematical treatment would be able to explain the concepts on more than a superficial level. I was defininately wrong. This is one of the best introductions to what deep learning is all about. The concepts are explained thoroughly, with small example neural networks that really help you work through the mechanics. Read this book to understand the core concepts, find another to supplement then detailed mathematics."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent book for people with programming skills interested in Deep Learning. The authors do a great job explaining both the context and modern application of Deep Learning technologies in an approachable–and entertaining–way.It’s been available on Safari Books for a couple months. I read it there and purchased it on Amazon.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reading 'Deep Learning Illustrated' was a fantastic journey into the world of deep learning. The book is divided into two main parts which, depending on your goal and background, can be studied exclusively. The first part is a great comprehensive journey through the history of deep learning. This is especially valuable since many ML practitioners learn the code without a proper understanding of how and why it all started, which, in my opinion, is essential to a good comprehension of any scientific breakthrough. The second part focuses on the code which is complemented by a Github repository. This is a tougher part of the book since deep learning is a bit like rocket science, but the authors try to make it as easy as possible by using relatively simple language and explaining every chunk of code without overdoing the math part so you can quickly immerse yourself in the world of neural networks and start working on your own examples. I finished the book within a few weeks and despite having worked on my own DL projects before I still was able to gain a lot of new knowledge and understanding about those amazing methods."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I zoomed through ""Deep Learning Illustrated,"" a great must-read byJon Krohn for anybody interested in the topic. I loved the parts where we get to work with a network using Keras. The book is divided into 3 parts, where the 3rd part relies on what went on the previous parts."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're expecting lots of charts and diagrams about how deep learning/AI works, you'll be disappointed.It's ""illustrated"" in the sense that there's worked examples of models (along with the code), but NOT in the sense that there's diagrams etc. explaining how it all works.If you're new to this kind of material, you'll probably only find the first section useful. The rest is too advanced for non-practitioners.It seems over-priced for what you actually get. One of the more disappointing reads I've bought this year."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an excellent first book on Deep Learning. The major basic architectures are covered, and everything is carefully documented. There are no function calls with mystery parameters, or annoying statements like ""Obviously, there is no rational number p such that p^2 = 2"".  The only fault is the appendix on backpropagation is a bit unclear - a better exposition can be found in other sources like Aggarwal."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I appreciate Audrey Watters' blog on the education technology industry so I was predisposed to like this book. I have also written about my opposition to the framing of ""personalized learning"" as something done to learners by designers of instructional technology. But as I read, I was surprised how ""in the weeds"" it got about B.F. Skinner's foray into programmed learning and how little it helped the reader contextualize these actions in the larger time period and cultural milieu. Page after page of detailed contract negotiations are described in minute detail. To get through it, I had to rely on my graduate school coursework on the history of psychology and my own childhood exposure to ""teaching machines"" to fill in the many missing components of this work.To clarify: the author is not a historian of education. She is a technology education journalist who stumbled into an archive and enjoyed capturing the blow-by-blow of a spectacular (for its time) edtech business failure. Watters offers a modest rationale for staying firmly in the archives of mid-20th century history academics and businessmen, and only occasionally connects her topic to the present day. But while historians contextualize their storytelling by weaving together, integrating, and challenging perspectives from other historians, this writer leaves that important work for a final chapter, and it feels strangely tacked on as an afterthought."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was drawn to this book after reading Watters’ biting commentaries on the current-day ed tech landscape. While Teaching Machines does the field a service by revealing that naive enthusiasm for ed tech is nothing new, the book unfortunately devolves into The Trials and Tribulations of B. F. Skinner, leaving just one short chapter for Watters to survey the post-Skinner landscape and offer her opinions. That’s a shame, given that Watters has so much to say."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This text offers a detailed description in each of 10 case studies about how to build a machine learning solution to the particular problem mentioned. The authors do this in R, and are extensively descriptive about the mechanics of writing R code. If you've never written a computer program, but want to understand how to implement a prewritten machine learning tool in R, this book could be of assistance. However, I'm not sure the authors actually understand the mathematical theory of machine learning; in this book they constantly substitute descriptions of how to select appropriate algorithm parameters with a trial-and-error approach, they do not explain how the algorithms work, and I'm not sure they ever mention the mechanics of ""learning"" with respect to mathematics. The book has brief passages about machine learning hidden amongst vast chapters about how to read computer directories and load data, etc. Again this book could be useful to the reader who understands ML, but not computer programming."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is just ok and barely touches the surface of the topics it discusses. If you're looking for an introduction to machine learning and the R language, I think you're better off with ""Data Mining with R"" by Torgo. It's a bit more expensive, but not without good reason."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,I enjoyed reading this book.Pro's:The text is parsimonious.The examples are interesting.The coding is clever.The book is less expensive and easier to understand than most Springer texts.Con's:A substantial part of the code is peripheral tasks; this can be skipped.Some of the code is out of date.These Con's are trivial.  The book is great.  I would buy any other books written by these authors.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This book may be good for those with little mathematical or statistical background, but its background information sections are too long and its treatment of ML topics too superficial for the book to be very useful for someone with the requisite background to actually implement the methods described in the book."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,I learned a little about the R language and how a lot of scientist of physicist use it the write functions to dynamically create graphs to analyze the data they compiled. It also encompasses a lot of the same math you learn in statistics classes which makes sense. I even ended up downloading an R language reference app from the Apple app store to have an object reference of the language.
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"As other reviews have noted, this book is R-heavy. And R turns out to be a poor choice for a lot of this data manipulation. As a ""hacker"" I'd prefer to use python or something similar for a lot of the code and then use R for the stuff that it's good at. Also the kindle formatting of this book is terrible. The code is formatted very poorly (I hope this is a kindle translation problem and not the way that it looks in the book). That poor formatting makes it difficult to read through the code. I'd recommend anyone who knows a decent programming language should try a different book."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The way this is formatted for Kindle makes it basically unusable.  Page numbers in the middle of the text, mangled figures and tables, no chapter breaks and more.  I had to buy the book again in paper."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The book structure is very good, it introduces different class of ML techniques (supervised/unsupervised/mixed) and for each explain the main concepts. It is based mainly on the CARET package, which for now (Feb 2020) is the best option for ML in R. I also liked the fact that the author chose to use only the R-base package rather than the Tidyverse, so that everything can be understood withouth assuming previous knowledge. I think that to begin with ML using R this is definitely a book to have on the shelf...However, the amount of typos is annoying. The code ouput is often different from the one explained (see picture for an example). Being a book for beginners the fact the a confusion matrix cannot be accurately explained makes it hard to confidently go through the more complex parts. It's a good book, but it definitely needs to be revised. I would recommend to wait for the second edition."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This book very nicely introduces basic machine learning concepts like regression, decision trees, and neural networks and how to easily build, train, and evaluate models in R. In the final chapter, the author ties everything together nicely by showing how to tie everything together using the excellent caret package.The overall information is fantastic. However, this book has a surprising number of errors. These were mostly instances where the text showed one value, but the sample output showed another, perhaps due to code being re-run without using the same random seed. There were also instances where figure references were wrong. Although they didn't hurt my ability to learn, they were a big distraction, and could make things difficult for someone new to R or to ML."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a nice, simple, and comprehensive introduction on how to go about doing Machine Learning in R programming environment and I would have definitely recommended it for beginners were it not for the incredibly high number of either minor typos or just outright wrong text included in this book. There are pages where the author is saying one thing, while the code and the results are showing something else. In some places, the author refers to Appendix for additional statistical details, but there is no such Appendix to be found. As a beginner myself, I spent many minutes self-flagellating over why I didn't understand something that was obvious to the author before I realized that there was an error in the book. If you were to buy this book, I would recommend that you code along and not rely on the outputs shown in the book. When I shell out about $50 on a book, the *least* I expect is that somebody has proofread it before publishing and mass-distributing it. Really disappointed with O'Reilly Publishers."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Dr. Chang has written the most complete text on AI in healthcare to date. As a clinician who has great interest and training in machine learning/artificial intelligence, I not only appreciated the technical sections of the book, but also the history of AI in healthcare section and the author's views and insights on the trajectory of AI in healthcare in the future and its adoption in everyday practice. I have used the information presented in Dr. Chang's book extensively to prepare for presentations on AI in healthcare to interested colleagues and healthcare executives."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What an outstanding contribution to the field of AI and data science in medicine. I'm a clinician interested in AI, and this book is the perfect introduction. Plenty of basic details for a clinician new to the field, yet packed with details that really go beyond the superfiical knowledge of AI in most popular press articles or other briefer guides to the topic. I really loved the invited commentaries sprinkled throughout the book from a wide variety of experts and leaders in this rapidly-emerging field. There are a number of typos and heavy use of acronyms and other technical terms that aren't always clearly defined, but this only minimally impacts understanding the concepts in this book. Highly recommend for anyone in medicine seeking to go beyond the basics in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This text organizes enough detail on the concepts of AI in healthcare for the reader to understand them while not getting too far into the detailed mathematics behind the process. It includes up-to-date perspectives from those currently using AI in their business models. It gives the reader the understanding of the language needed to bring these ideas to senior leadership to move them forward within their own organization.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A comprehensive overview of the relevant AI topics for the clinician as well as the data scientists and any non-clinician who wish to understand the nuances in this domain. The book also includes about 100 commentaries by many authors in the field and an extensive compendium and glossary. There are only a few books in this category but this one clearly stands above the rest. The book is also by far the best value of any book in this domain.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good book, but it is much more a text book than anything else.  It’ll give you a solid understanding of the words and terminology and there are a lot of interspersed outside author articles.  It is not a how to guide.  But if you just need to have a working understanding of what is involved and your background is in medicine, and…you don’t mind a textbook….i think you’ll enjoy this book."

Have some exposure to Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks but otherwise not much.I find this book very easy and have covered till 6th chapter now(in 3 weeks). I can confidently say, I follow almost 85% of the content that I have read so far. But without a good grounding in set notations, probability, logic etc one could find it not that easy to turn pages.Obviously doesnt cover latest developments as the original text was published in 1997.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was searching for a book which can give me a brief idea about Machine learning. I am a computer engineer so for me if the language was little more technical then also there was not going to be a problem. To my surprise the book is actually a master piece written in a very lucid language, a layman can also learn alot from this book.This book describer the Machine learning systems in great detail and presents before you the vast universe of machine learning. The best thing about this book is it can arouse curiosity in you."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is a master piece and  there was a lot of learning for me (Ph.D physicist working as a data scientist) also. The author truly deserves to be put in 'Feynman's class'. There are multiple paragraphs which are quotable. I cannot imagine someone can write a book on machine learning in the style of a 'crime mystery'. The author has a very deep knowledge of the subjects he touch upon. After reading this book SVM and  Neural Networks look to me like living & breathing entities and not just cold algorithms. Have a great reading !

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As someone who tried to learn Deep Learning through several online courses, one of the biggest issues was wading through too much theory and the inability to apply the concepts outside the course.However, Practical Deep Learning was extremely refreshing in several aspects - its structure, applicability, intelligibility, and empathy.The learner can start applying the concepts from the very beginning with the help of the GitHub repo which makes one think outside the theory in the practical realm as soon as they kick-off.And I found this book to be very unlike any technical book that I ever read. Explaining highly complex concepts with real-life analogies and a sense of humor clearly shows deep empathy by the authors for the readers who can be complete novices to an expert.This book is one of the engaging technical writing out there and I found it so helpful that after the first 3 chapters I ordered another one as a gift for a friend.I can't thank the authors  Siddha Ganju, Meher Anand Kasam & Anirudh Koul for all the effort you guys put to this book for all of us. Its gotten a lot of us hooked on Deep Learning."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a really good book for getting into applied machine learning. It contains a lot of well thought out examples, corresponding code and case studies. If you are looking to dip your toes in the world of deep learning, this is a really good book for doing so.This book is going to be particularly helpful for the novice and enthusiast crowd. However, as mentioned in the preface, even experienced machine learning people can benefit by thinking about possible applications they would never have thought about.One of the best things about this book and relevant resources is that the corresponding code repository is actively being maintained and worked on. As with any software book, the book code may get outdated. My recommendation is that instead of relying on just the code in the book, actively look at the GitHub repository for the latest updates. The repo maintainers (authors, helpers, and likely altruistic readers) have done a good job of keeping the code up-to-date with newer changes to the interfaces.As a person coming in from a deeper ML background, one of my (minor) gripes, is that I find some citations lacking. However, unlike researchers, this book is more meant for people who are just beginning in this field, and thus it's not really a needed thing.Kudos for addressing the point of bias in the data, and the lack of explainability of the models. These are indeed a major problem in a lot of ML systems being deployed in production, and I believe that every person, ranging from the novice to the expert, needs to be aware of, and more importantly, make sure they mitigate it as much as possible.In terms of the implementation aspects, I really enjoyed the descriptions of the components and giving concrete examples of how to go about implementing the application in various platforms (cloud servers, android, IOS, javascript app, robots, take your pick.)To conclude, this is a really good book, with something for every level of ML practitioner, and even for people with no experience in ML."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a deep learning practitioner and have been using TensorFlow building recommendation systems for production for several years. Learning the theory behind deep learning is one thing. Applying it to real-world scenarios is a whole another thing. What I really liked about this book is:1. The book stresses on building projects that work - first in as little lines of code as possible (and sometimes even without code), so the reader can get excited about something working. For example, the very initial autonomous car code (AWS DeepRacer) was 15 lines only. And then it dives into various aspects of how an engineer at an FAANG (or alike) company, would implement it at scale, benchmarking the cost, speed, memory, and energy usage of different approaches.2. It gave me an extensive overview of how deep learning is revolutionizing different industries (outside my own) through their projects and case studies.3. It puts the right words (and pictures) to deep learning theory and teaches how to apply them in real life using simple language. I came to learn deep learning through books full of math formulas and I am very surprised that this book managed to explain things in a very intuitive way without the heavy use of formulas.4. I found the “Creators Desk” boxes throughout the book were a nice touch, where people who built frameworks or products share their backstory behind how it came about.5. All the code has been made available on Github. Although I own a GPU, I can imagine how easy it is to train Keras and TensorFlow examples directly in one's browser without any framework installation (a rather tedious job) using Google Colab."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am currently a PhD student quickly catching up on AI/ML methodologies and needed a fast and to the point primer. One of the main issues I've had with several books is the inability to follow along the book with datasets and code (not including 'code' written in the text). This book includes a github repo with code/data to follow along. In my case, I didn't have a free GPU but the book also comes with pre-filled Google Colab notebooks too (like Jupyter notebooks) which make it *exceedingly* easy to follow along even without having any software on my personal computer.All in all, the content has been quite useful, rich in application, easy to follow along with (no excuses since Google Colab doesn't use local resources), and I've accomplished the goal I've set out with — highly recommend!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have discovered great value in reading Practical Deep Learning for Cloud, Mobile, and Edge for several reasons 1) Increased deep learning awareness with many useful case studies and real-world examples 2) Honed skills with new tips and tricks for a more in-depth understanding while quickly deploying and scaling deep learning models with NVIDIA's Jetson Nano Developer Kit and most importantly 3) I'm having fun while learning how to solve today's problems programming simple robotics and self-driving miniature cars. Anirudh Koul, Siddha Ganju, and Meher Kasam, along with their many colleagues and Deep Learning Industry Experts, have assembled an O'Reilly team to create a passionate, practical guidebook with rich content for students, teachers, data scientists, and professionals."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I attended a conference where the authors of the book were the speakers. Their talk was really informative, so I gave the book a shot. I’m always on the lookout for good resources related to Deep Learning. I found it to be a good read as compared to other resources which usually have deep mathematical content which I have a hard time grasping. I like how the book starts with a brief history & gradually increases in technicality while maintaining interest. The book kept surprising me with examples of AI-using products that exist. It dives into a few of those examples  to help understand exactly what kind of AI has been used and approaches them from a developers perspective. Overall, it helped develop a good foundation for me. I also really liked the chapter on Edge devices and used it to develop jetbot. I was already fascinated by jetbot but my niece was really interested in it. She took it for show and tell in school and I told her how to run it."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,I'm through the first 3 chapters and there are typos (or poorly edited) code in the print version. Be sure to read through the code on Github. I haven't executed the code so can't speak to its correctness.The writing style is a bit off but could be due to the use of Grammerly (mentioned in Personal Acknowledgements).The lack of a digital standalone book is also a minus. You'd think in this age O'Reilly would try to reduce the costs associated with printing books rather than try to make what they can on (subscription) profits.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What I absolutely love about this book is the ease with which it introduces you to the concepts of Deep Learning and helps clearly differentiate between Machine Learning and Deep Learning with simple easy to understand examples, not only for Data Science enthusiasts but also for people who are just getting started. I absolutely love the fact that they have shared their code on GitHub which saves us so much time and helps execute the same as opposed to figuring out how to set up everything and type in the code which is super distracting and slows down the process of actually diving into the concepts. I am on Chapter 4 now and it's been a very good addition to my existing set of Data Science books!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have done research with Machine Learning algorithms and always detested learning concepts from books all because they were based on just theory with lack of practical examples. This book was an exception. I was certainly surprised to see the range of Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning concepts explained with real-world examples (specially in computer vision), and clear step by step instructions. Uber, Giphy, Pinterest, Google Image Search, Alibaba, Pixel 3 phones, Youtube, Spotify - just a small sample of apps powered by AI that the book reverse engineers and digs deep into - this makes it easier for the reader to learn how to adopt the concepts in their own solutions. While I had little python familiarity, picking Keras and Tensorflow while solving problems kept learning interesting and exciting. This book is a must read for anyone entering the deep learning field and even for experts as it aligns with today’s industrial requirements on Responsible AI, Privacy, and Fairness. Lastly, kudos for the authors on making it a fun read with their witty comments here and there!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is truly amazing. While I don't have prior machine learning / artificial intelligence experience, I found this book an amazing resource to learn about ML and AI and ramp up fast. The variety and depth of content and technical knowledge presented is commendable. The content is well structured, practical and very easy to follow. The authors have done a great job in explaining the concepts with real world examples.In about a week of picking it up, the book inspired me to envision new ideas and help introducing a deep learning application at work. If you are looking for a resource to gain practical working knowledge of deep learning and neural networks, this is THE BOOK. Go for it."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"We are so used of doing and thinking as it has been done for countless generations that many people think that inequality no longer exists. Unfortunately it is not. Discrimination exists by not taking into account the diversity and particular needs of women, 50% of the population. Studies, planning, security systems and a long etc, do not count on women to act and most of them fail. But there are still those who think that the problem is because women are not men."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,The book talks about one of the major ongoing issues of our times. However it points more to find someone to blame rather that fully explain each point and propose a solution. Many chapters blow your mind and make you realize things you've never expected. On other chapters it doesn't dig further on the issue and the result is a lazy shallow explanation. It is more a book that aim to make you feel something rather than understand something.

There is such a great array of data backing-up each argument and although you might find yourself glazing over the words sometimes, the next fact in line will make you re-read what you missed. The author compiled and structured all this information, which should be acknowledged and understood by each person, information which would otherwise be missed or disregarded if read from a different source.It’s a great perspective and I feel how we’re slowly, finally, moving towards removing the biases accumulated around this subject."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This outstanding piece of work gives the world vital insight into the myriad ways that the needs of women are accidentally or deliberately ignored by organisations and Governments all over the world and the impact this has on women. Caroline Criado Perez has identified and distilled so much information from countless sources to provide leaders from every walk of life with evidence of how our infrastructure and mindset is currently failing women, and has done so for centuries. This book shows us that we view the world through the eyes of men, and therefore fail to notice the 50% of citizens who are not men. It is an eye-opening, mindbending read, which deserves huge recognition and will wake the feminist in every reader, regardless of their gender.Paula Fyans, author of The Invisible Job"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,This amazing book really deserves more stars but it is not a lighthearted book that you can read from beginning to end (which is my normal type of read) but as I read it made me angry so I had to keep putting it down only to pick it up again. I had no idea of just how invisible women really are or how they are dominated and driven over by the ego/drive of men. It also makes you realise how the majority of men don’t see this either. A real revelation backed up by strong evidence.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In this book Caroline Criado Perez does an excellent job of exposing how women are systematically ignored and overlooked in a vast range of activities. With excellent research she shows how the world is designed by men for men, and the consequences of this on women everywhere. In many areas she poses devastatingly simple questions about how this came about and why the needs of half the population have simply not been taken into account. The author succeeds in being informative but also entertaining and while she is clearly deeply angry she maintains a style that lets the data speak for itself. Highly recommended and reading it as a man, deeply embarrassing."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book does what it’s title suggest - A case study approach to gaining valuable insights from real data with machine learning.If you are new to data science, then this book is not meant for you to as it won’t help you to learn the mathematical fundamentals. However, if you already have some exposure to data science, then this is the right book for you to dive into hands on mode and work on various data science projects using Python. It does provides step by step approach for most of the projects discussed so people who have the basic knowledge of python can also implement them and experience the magic of data science. A good way to build your data science portfolio."

Having reviewed this book and doing some of the projects in it I believe this is the right set of learning materials for me.I have ordered subsequent books in this series and looking forward to diving in."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book completes my code-is-there ML trilogy with the other two be 'an introduction to statistical learning' by James et al. and 'the elements of statistical learning' by Hastie et al. They share my favorite style: theory is first presented and then code for your to execute the theory.The book did not follow a classical receipt for introducing data science. Instead, it groups topics considering their impact on real business environment. It is nice that the author with rich experience frankly share what are the impactful knowledge in business data science!While this book can well be a textbook, it definitely can also be a good reference or as a very readable book for outsiders to know about business data science (potentially have somehow coding!)."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a really unusual book; I can't think of another like it, really.By applying modern statistical techniques--many of which the author developed during his meteoric academic career--to a series of datasets, Taddy highlights solutions to the real-world problems of teasing out the truth from uncooperative data.Many reviewers have commented that the book did not have enough of the usual machine learning material for their tastes.  The author comes from a statistical background, and the tools he highlights are more grounded in statistics than some of the deep learning material that a lot of readers seem to be looking for.  Fortunately, there are TONS of books catering to that segment of the readership.This book really is more about getting beyond finding correlations between variables to getting at the causal mechanisms generating data.  If you're looking to get a quick bump to your scores in Kaggle competitions, this may not be the book for you.The examples in the book are copiously illustrated with code written in base R.  All example code is available on the author's github page.  Working through the code while reading the book really reinforces the material immensely.Unfortunately, there are a few typos, including a confidence-shaking mis-statement of Bayes' Rule early on.  (Super ironic, since Taddy's Bayesian credentials are rock solid.)  Given that the author has left academia for industry, I'm guessing the typos won't get fixed anytime soon, which is unfortunate, because I really think this is an important book.If anything, I think this book sells itself short with its title.  Business Data Science is really about the craft of data analysis more generally and deserves to be read by a wide audience of statistical practitioners."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reading this book makes me re-evaluate my knowledge about statistical and machine learning models. I have taken dozens of courses in statistics and machine learning at the graduate level. However, this book makes me realize that applying these models in practice is way more difficult in some sense, than figuring out the technical stuff on paper. Models, in theory, make all kinds of assumptions, and when they are applied in practice, one may see surprising results than those presented on paper.Matt's background in both academia and industry makes him the perfect author to write such a book, that bridges the gap between theoretical models and implementations in practice. There are so many tricks and notes that I appreciate, which can save me tons of time if I were in a position to implement those methods. I also like the in-line code a lot."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this book as I find it easy to follow along with. The explanation are clear and simple and you could easily adapt the ideas to your own work. At no point when using it did I work through a load of pages and then reflect thinking I've done xy and z there but in truth I haven't learnt anything. The teaching does make it stick.That said compared to some of the other ML books I have, this is much less maths based. And also you wont learn much code (or about the algorithms and models used) outside of load up a csv, type in the relevant model algorithm parameters, run some predictions and hey presto you have a model that works... not so simple in real life!Its definitely great for getting started but glosses over a lot of the important steps regarding data pre processing."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic as an introductory textbook, would recommend to anyone new to R and ML . . . the only lacking thing was a more fundamental/technical perspective in certain areas (ANNs for example). Otherwise a must-have for those venturing into this sort of field."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I needed
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book has opened a new world for me! I bought it to get some understanding about machine learning. The book holds everything what it promises in the title. The author gives a very gentle introduction to key issues in statistics. Even simple things like the difference between mean and median are explained.But the book is also a crash course on R. Parallel to my reading I could experiment with the data and the R  environment. Especially intriguing for me was that one could follow the data analysis hands-on with real data sets! (I didn’t know previously that there are real data sets free available on the internet – for instance at the UCI machine learning repository). And all this could be done without previous knowledge of R.I have to confess that some of the statistical details in the later chapters I didn’t understand completely in my first reading. But I didn’t expect that with my first dive into the domain of machine learning I will become a professional data scientist. I got some understanding about the main concepts and know now where to go for further practice and to build up my skills for analysing big data.The book is also (almost) perfect from an educational point of view. After two introductory chapters (one about general features of machine learning and one about the first steps and general syntax of R) the next seven chapters follow the same outline:(1) Providing a general understand of the algorithms with strength and weaknesses: Explaining the most important formulas and the effects demonstrating with some illustrative sample data. This provides you with a qualitative understanding of the method.(2) The chapter continues with a practical demonstration in the following order:(a) Collecting data: Where to get the data set, references and explaining the structure of the data.(b) Exploring and preparing the data. Every R-command to load the data, to transform etc. is explained and written down as code. The data and even these command are provided in a .zip archive at github.(c) Training the model on the data(d) Evaluating the model performance, looking for and discussing the false positives and false negatives including their effects in the real world.(e) Improving the performance of the model.(f) And finally a summary with lessons learned from this chapter.Like the first two chapters the structure of the last three chapters are different too:  They are dedicates on strategies for evaluating and improving of model performances and some other specialised issues on machine learning.Some suggestions for the third edition of machine learning with R: I mentioned the word „almost perfect“: The only three things I was missing:(A) Please provide a section with exercises and solutions for the next edition! This would be very important for the transfer from understanding to applicable skills.(B) I would like to see one application in learning analytics with a real data set from the educational domain.(C) And last not least – there should be a new final chapter „Where to go from here now“.But all in all: One of the best tutorial books I have read!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An ""easy"" read with good explanation of the statistics and math of the various models. Good data sets (can be downloaded) to work on. The steps on how to prepare the data, dealing with missing values, applying the models, interpreting the results and improving model performance are explained in a logical way. Like the book very much."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"By page count, this is primarily a book on R, with some additional time spent on machine learning.There is way too much time spent on R, dedicated to such things as parsing email messages, and spidering webpages, etc. These are things that no-one with other tools available would do in R. And it's not that it's easier to do it in R, it's actually harder than using an appropriate library, like JavaMail. And yet, while much time is spent in details, like regexes to extract dates (ick!), more interesting R functions are given short shrift.There's some good material in here, but it's buried under the weight of doing everything in R. If you are a non-programmer, and want to use only one hammer for everything, then R is not a bad choice. But it's not a good choice for developers that are already comfortable with a wider variety of tools.I'd recommend   Programming Collective Intelligence           by Segaran, if you would describe yourself as a ""Hacker""."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is basically the bible of reinforcement learning. It introduces all necessary and relevant algorithms for the beginner.However, there are a number of significant drawbacks. I am a mathematician and want to know everything in detail. This is where the book struggles a lot.It contains a number of very unclear definitions. They are hidden among the text. Luckily there is a table of symbols at the beginning.Other quantities are just used in text and argument as if everyone knew them (for example: epsilon soft policies are never introduced. The glossary just references to the said text.Theorems are not clearly indicated, there are just in the text. That makes it very hard to find them.Overall a great book, but without the lecture notes of David Silver (one of Sutton's students) the book would be a lot harder to understand. I also recommend Silver's lecture on reinforcement learning (on the YouTube channel of DeepMind, the company where DS works).The two stars are mainly lost for inconsequent writing and confused structure. Still a book worth buying and definitely the starting point for research in the area."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"In real world, three cohorts would approach Machine Learning differently -  A. Programmers - ""How"" - interested in quickly learning the libraries, tips/tricks to scale algorithms with larger data sets  B. Theorists - ""What"" - interested in choosing the right algorithm, design ensemble, selecting and extracting right features  C. Fashionists - ""Show"" - in this category, some of the even basic reporting/analytics are not termed ""Machine Learning"", need enough buzzwords pieced together to repaint the old apps.Flach's book is a great source for those who are 75%-25% between first two, and perhaps even greater especially if your Linear Algebra (basics) is not too rusty. It gives a wide and somewhat deep tour of the landscape broken into four paradigms (Quantitative/Analytical, Logical, Geometric, Probabilitisic) and does a real good job on feature design. The book is interspersed with some key insights that are not to be found elsewhere (e.g., how the 'pseudo-inverse' in OLS is really decorrelate-scale-normalize the distribution; Skew-Kurtosis are the statistical measure of ""shape""; Naive Bayes is not only Naive but also not particularly Bayesian; How Laplacian Estimate generalizes into Pseudo-Counts and then to m-estimate etc.). After ""deep reading"" of the book over a month or so, I also went through Flach's detailed 500+ slide presentation (check out his website) on this book. It was very useful to improve solutions several key machine learning problems at work. Flach especially shines on usage of ROC to algorithm comparison which has been his key research area.A few items that I think would've nailed 5-stars -1. Total omission of Neural Nets (ANNs)2. Only a glimpse of RBF while discussing the generalization from kNN to GMMs - as a key activation function more detailed treatment on RBF would help.3. Flach does a really good job of summarizing - at the end of each chapter and at the end of the book - the key insights. A similar ""Real World Insights"", which are interspersed in the book (e.g., how Naive Bayes is a GREAT classifier, but lousy estimator), aggregated would have helped.Overall, going back in time, I would buy and study it again. For a great first book, I recommend Hastie's ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning"", or Hal Duame's ""A Course In Machine Learning"" (ciml.info). After finishing this book, I would recommend ""Pattern Classification"" (Duda, Stork) which further elaborates on most stuff here and also has a great elucidation on Neural Networks."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you need a ML book as a teacher, Machine Learning – The art and science of algorithms that make sense of data, is definitely the one you need. It covers most ML algorithms, divided by genre (tree, rule, ensemble, etc.). From a teaching point of view, the book is quite comprehensive. From a practical point of view, some chapters can be skipped as too theoretical.The perspective taken by Peter Flach, is very different from most data mining and data science books. The focus is on maths and stats rather than business problem solving. Worth a read if you need to get the theoretical concepts behind ML algorithms."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The subtitle ""the art and science of algorithms that make sense of data"" is completely misleading and the main reason I am rating it two stars.A more accurate subtitle would be ""mathematical foundations of machine learning"".There is little in the way of algorithms and when present they are very high level algorithms.The book is fairly well written, but not suitable as a first book of machine learning.Buy this book only if you have grasped the intuition of how the basic machine learning algorithm work and want to go deeper into their mathematical foundations .Avoid this book if :  you want an overview of ML algorithms  you want to explor ML use cases  you want to explore the workflow of ML proyects."

I am an undergraduate CS major with a decent amount of math experience, and for me this book is a tough but rewarding read. I constantly find myself reading the same section 2 or 3 times in a row, restling with the concepts until I can grasp some intuition of the topics bring discussed. The author is very thorough in their writing, making sure to fill in the details so you dont get left behind in the mathematical notation. The book is filled with beautiful graphs and other figures to further help the reader along in their understanding of machine learning.As a heads up, this book is heavy on the theory and light on the application, so keep that in mind when considering this book for purchase. It isn't going to give you a simple recipe to plug into R. It did however, lay out the intricacies of machine learning in a very abstract and methodical fashion, allowing the reader to gain a much deeper insight into the mechanics of the popular ML techniques than a more practical book would."

The research is phenomenal and it's dreadful that it has never been done before."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is incredible. The author has managed to pull together lots of research and present a compelling argument whilst still managing to make the book accessible to everyone. There is heaps of data but it does not feel dense or difficult to understand. Some of the facts will shock you. I like to think I'm pretty well-versed on the topic, but it was an eye opener to me. I have recommended it to everyone that will listen. Definitely not just a book for women either. I implore you to buy/recommend this for your son, father, partner... everyone!The only qualm I have is the binary approach to gender. The author does point out that they are referring to sex and when you get into the stats it is clear to see why they have to take a binary approach.PS dont be put off by its length - I promise it is not as long as it seems.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book gives a framework for a complete 360 view of how to be a Machine Learning Engineer who can not only solve applied research problems but can also encourage thinking through product angle and eventually productionizing these models and scale them. Given my background in applied research, this was part of the reason for me to pick this book based on the table of contents and it surely hit the mark.  It not only covers theoretical concepts for beginners but also the process of building practical applications widely used across the industry, with the help of checklists, QnA, insights from teams who developed the products.  One of the great part of the book is - all the best practices summarized, well documented for anyone starting new or experienced folks, plus the case studies showing how they were used in actual products. The content covers a range of in-depth details for TensorFlow, Keras, CoreML all the way to cloud concepts for Google Cloud, AWS, Azure. Overall this was a different take on AI than most other online courses I have seen so far, and hence would highly recommend this."

Furthermore, the Github repo with sample code allows readers to follow along example training pipelines, which makes everything all the more friendly for beginners. The book uses simple language which effectively guides readers to creating deep learning pipelines on their own. The content of the book is very thorough and covers a variety of different topics, leaving readers ready to create their own practical applications."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At a time when AI has become such a hot topic for everyone from industry bosses to bloggers and my eighty year old neighbour, it's truly a gift to have encountered a book that doesn't just explain you what it is but teaches you how to do it as well. It's simply your trustful guide through all the other material out there. As a project manager and consultant, I finally managed to make sense of what kind of businesses one can develop from a bottom-up approach to AI. As a teacher in writing and design, the book has allowed me to give my students fun exercises to start having fun with Machine Learning.If AI is a forest, this book is your lamp. Get it now and start building for yourself!"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a Networking Engineer, one fine day I decided to pick up this book as I wanted to understand concepts of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning ; as the next big thing is Intelligent Networks! Honestly I did not have high expectations as my experience tells me that most technical books are heavy and monotonous. But this book was a gush of fresh air. Now before I go into the details , I must mention that only a minimal knowledge of Python and associated libraries like Keras and TensorFlow is a pre-requisite here. Rest assured , the book will take care good care of you and you will end up learning a lot of Python as well , if you already don't know ! Coming back to the meaty stuff .. The writing style is humorous and interactive. It keeps you motivated to read one chapter after the other. Every chapter is followed by a case study that solidifies your understanding and helps you gauge some serious practical applications. In my opinion the writing style makes this text a technical ""fairy tale"" , if you will. The other point worth mentioning is that you do not need to read sequentially. Once you go past Chapter 3 you can pick up chapters as per your interest/requirements - Mobile Applications , Cloud etc. You can , therefore fine tune your reading as per YOUR requirements. Finally this book has a lot of code . Not only can you run and see the results for yourself, you can also optimize the algorithms for faster execution. Everything is available on the git hub. I highly recommend this book for AI enthusiasts as well as working professionals."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I can appreciate others who might think that this is a great book.... but I am a student using it and I have some very different opinions of it.First, although Mr. Bishop is clearly an expert in Machine Learning, he is also obviously a HUGE fan of Bayesian Statistics. The title of the book is misleading as it makes no mention of Bayes at all but EVERY CHAPTER ends with how all of the chapter's contents are combined in a Bayes method.  That's not bad it's just not clear from the title.  The title should be appended with ""... using Bayesian Methods""Second, while it is certainly a textbook, the author clearly has an understanding of the material that seems to undermine his ability to explain it.  Though there are mentions of examples there are, in fact, none.  There are many graphics and tiny, trivial indicators, but I can't help to think that every single one of the concepts in the book would have benefited from even a single application.  There aren't any.  I am lead to believe that if you are already aware of many of the methods and techniques that this would be an excellent reference or refresher.  As a student starting out I almost always have no idea what his intentions are.To make matter worse, he occasionally uses symbols that are flat-out confusing.  Why would you use PI for anything other than Pi or Product? He does.  Why use little k, Capital K, and Greek Letter Kappa (a K!) in a series of explanations. He does.  He even references articles that he has written... in 2008!!Every chapter seems to be an exercise to see how many equations he can stuff in it.  There are 300 in Chapter 2 alone.  Over and over and over again I have the feeling that he is trying to TELL me how to ride a bicycle when it would have been so much easier to at least let me see the view from behind the handle bars with my feet on the pedals.  Chapter five on Neural Nets, for example, is abysmally over-complicated.  Would you hand someone a dictionary and ask them to write a poem?  (""Hey, all the words you need are in here!"") Of course not.Third, the book mentions that there is a lot of information available on the web site.  The only info available on his website is a brief overview of the text, a detailed overview of the text (that's not a typo.... he has both), an example chapter, links to where the book can be purchased, and (actually, quite useful for creating slides) an archive of all of the figures available in the book.  There are no answers to problems or explorations of any part of the material.  The upcoming book might be amazing and exactly what I am looking for but it could be months away and another $50 or so to purchase it.  Hardly ideal. How about putting some of that MatLab code on your site?  *Something* to crystalize the concepts!Finally, while the intro indicates this might be a good book for Computer Scientists it would actually make more sense to call it a Math book.  More specifically a Statistics book.  There are no methods, no algorithms, no bits of pseudo-code, and (again) no applications are in the text.  Even examples that actually used hard numbers and/or elements from a real problem and explained would be much appreciated.Maybe I am being a little critical and perhaps I want for too much but in my mind if you are writing a book with the goal of TEACHING a subject, it would be in your interest to make things clear and illustrative.  Instead, the book feels more like a combination of ""I am smart. Just read this!"" and a reference text."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I need a good book about the fundamentals of pattern recognition for my master thesis. Based on the comments here I thought the book would be great in order to understand the concepts of pattern recognition. Furthermore, I hoped to find some useful real life examples in it and some hints about important pre conditions and steps required (e.g. data preparation) before using clustering and classification algorithms. However, the book did not help me at all. I would say that I am not a complete idiot who can't read formulas, but I hoped to learn about the concepts in a more understandable way (something similar to ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning"").Furthermore, the author's initial statement ""I have tried to keep the mathematical content of the book to the minimum necessary to achieve a proper understanding of the field"" seems to be a joke for me, e.g. Chapter 4 has 40 pages with about 150 formulas/mathematical equitations."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a current student at Booth who didn't get a chance to take Prof. Taddy's course, so I was very excited to dig into this book.  It was mostly what I was hoping for, with a few omissions.First, this is essentially a book on applied statistics from a business perspective, so exactly what you'd be hoping for if you're looking to utilize data science principles in real-world scenarios.  The complexity level of the book is absolutely beyond that of a complete beginner, however.  Familiarity with certain basic mathematical concepts is assumed, as well as a degree of proficiency with R.  I have definitely seen more approachable texts,so if you're a complete novice you may want to start elsewhere.  On the other hand, I don't think this is a book for 'experts' (at least based on some of the physics texts I've worked with in the past).  As the intro says, this is based on a curriculum for MBA students (I'd argue its really for more quantitatively-inclined MBA students), and I think it does a good job balancing on that fine line between novice and expert.However, once you get into it the book is really very detailed, with a lot of good examples.  I've only started my journey through the book, but so far I haven't noticed any glaring issues (nor would I expect to see any, to be honest).The reason I'm deducting a star is the machine learning section - I was really hoping for some useful practical examples of machine learning, convolutional neural nets, and similar.  However the chapter is more of a summarization of some of the research out there and gives a high-level overview of the terminology and actual applictions of AI.  Given that Coursera offers a really approachable course on this whole topic, I was expecting more out of what is essentially a textbook (especially one that advertises machine learning on the cover).If you're looking for a good mid-level work on big data concepts and applied statistics I think this is a great book to pick up (especially as its not priced like a textbook).  On the other hand, if you're looking for depth on ML, CNNs, AI, and similar then you'll want to look elsewhere.  The concepts this book covers are important theoretical background for ML/CNNs/AI, however if you're not a researcher/expert you can certainly get into that space without the depth presented in this book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, this book is really well done. I definitely recommend it, and certainly recommend it over other, lighter-weight intro to data science books.The author includes the (important) mathematics behind a lot of the statistical intuition and machine learning that's vital to data science, and does so without producing a dry textbook.I also liked how the author included caveats about the shortcomings of the various approaches as well as suggestions and solutions for how to best accommodate the issues that they might introduce.My one (minor) complaint is that the sample code in the book is in the R language. That's fine -- R is still a very common language in data science, and if you work in this field you'll certainly encounter it -- but I would have preferred Python, both for ease of reading and because Python is fast emerging as the dominant language."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Back in my days as an Analyst at a huge corporation in the 90's and early 2000's, I spent my 9 hour days making endless spreadsheets and doing pivot tables a billion different ways to deliver accurate reports for our Senior Executives on a daily, weekly, monthly, etc. basis. One report took so long to filter through the data, I began calling it my ""8 hour report"" because it literally took me all day to create that particular one each week, between pulling and analyzing all the data in that manual manner. At the time, that was the best we could do. Those days are long gone, and a LOT has changed since then - and most things like that are automated by software these days. I was really curious what businesses are up to these days in terms of data science, and was familiar with the concepts of this book - even though vaguely in some areas - and this really filled in a lot of blanks for me.My oldest son is a computer whiz who is ahead of his time, so I mainly got this book for him - even though it is over both of our heads in many parts. That said, this has invaluable information for anyone looking into Business Data Science, as it combines the best of science and engineering concepts to merge into a business context to take it to the next level - and THIS is what is in demand these days, and on the cutting edge of successful businesses.I like how it outlines the primary parts that make ML work, and how it shows where AI can also come in to help your business. I also like that it shows real world examples on how these things can be applied, especially with A/B experiments and applications of text analysis.There's a lot in here regarding scripting in R, frameworks for cloud computing, and a lot more to help you improve how you use your business data effectively for the best success. It's like a great mash-up of economics, computer science, statistics, etc. that balances well, and it gives you a leg up in your business decisions. While I don't pretend to know everything in this book, it really has a wealth of info and direction for me to dive more thoroughly into, and I think my son will greatly benefit from this book, as well. It certainly gets two thumbs up from us!"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For a stat rat (like myself) that was searching for a way to bridge my existing education with an updated primer in machine learning, Matt Taddy's Business Data Science: Combining Machine Learning and Economics to Optimize, Automate, and Accelerate Business Decisions (1st Edition) looked like a promising first step.Unfortunately, my issue is that I didn't really find the AI/ML content to really be all that useful.  I mean, the book does touch on some of the theoretical benefits of using AI/ML, but there's nothing really of any significant depth.  If you're looking to put any of this into practice, than this will not be the only book you need.That aside, the book IS really strong from the standpoint of applied analysis.  The writing is approachable, especially from the perspective of a non-post doc like myself.  The assumed knowledge base is actually on the low side, giving the book a wider audience still, without really killing the usefulness for those with broader data science knowledge in the first place.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"He has many examples of code at work so you can catch a glimpse of what it's capable of.  Leafing through the book, it looked overwhelming and unusable.  Putting time into it, it starts to make sense.  It helps if you've meddled in R or Python.He goes into great detail about how information can be deceiving and making a solution that can accommodate changing and unknown inputs is rewarding.This book took me a long time to get through, but I'm sure it pales in comparison to the amount of time it took to write.  Nearly every page has algorithms that all would take time to be constructed and tested for accuracy, then explained for their uses.  It's worth every penny.Highly recomennded"

This is a very comprehensive guide - I would imagine it could be used as a textbook in a broad survey course. If you do not have a background in statistics, linear algebra, and/or computer programming, it would be better to start with an introductory text. This book provides excellent practical examples of how to use data science tools in the real-world. It is easy to get bogged down in theory and miss the (random) forest for the (decision) trees (...that was an attempt a joke, ha...). The examples in the book are in R."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"In the chapter of the introduction, the author says the book is primarily about asset pricing. The “asset pricing” here refers to complicated and abstract mathematical models used in academicians. These models plainly complicate the concepts that are already known to us. For practitioners, the models will not give them an insightful idea and an intuitive understanding of how the modern financial market works.The book also does not have program codes, the necessary materials that a modern learning book should have. If you really want to efficiently study how machine learning can be used in finance, I suggest you buy the books written by real experts (say those published by O'Reilly or Springers)"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of the best books on ML in Finance, specifically in Asset Pricing. It goes over several models, methodologies, and applications of ML in Asset Pricing. There are no codes or programs that the book provides, but it is clearly not written to serve that purpose anyway. As an academician, I greatly enjoyed reading it and found it extremely useful for my research. I would also definitely use it for a graduate-level ML course in Finance."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you need a proper introduction to Machine Learning for professional reasons or even just for your own edification, do yourself a favor and pick up this gem of text.Make sure you are 'language agnostic' before you begin. Let me explain, right now the python libraries are all the rage: Pytorch, Keras, TensorFlow, ScikitLearn, etc... Thus, you might be tempted to believe that in getting yourself acquainted with ML in R you are putting yourself at a disadvantage. You'd be wrong.Truth it, you should be approaching the subject with the idea of learning from a conceptual and practical standpoint, albeit at a high level. The language you use will make little difference at the beginning. This was my main concern as I needed to learn ""python ML"" for professional reasons. Make no mistake, this book along with the available code up on the author's GitHub will guide you through the language, the hard to grasp concepts, and the terminology in a way that is pedagogically so effective that you'd be left wondering how it is that most technical books never reach this level of clarity. You'll be carrying conversations with experienced ML practitioners in no time, without embarrassing yourself (too much).Take it for what it is though, an introduction. If you need to know every pedantic detail about how neural networks learn, the heavy mathematical proofs behind the algorithms, etc., then you'd be much better served looking elsewhere.Once you go through this text, you'll be able to jump on the Python bandwagon all while avoiding the risk of having the language's technicalities distract you from the core concepts.Go for it, happy learning."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this book with some prior knowledge on Machine Learning. I would say that I am very pleased with my purchase. The only weakness of this book is that it mostly offers an intuitive explanation behind the algorithms, without going into much depth. Therefore, the book works extremely well for algorithms that make very small assumptions or whose procedures are simple: Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, Market Basket Analysis, etc. On the other hand, for more mathematically complicated procedures, like OLS Regression, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks the explanation is poor because without some math it is really hard to perfectly convey what the model is doing.The examples are well thought and I like how the book works the examples from questions previously posed in the chapter.On the code front, the accompanying code is simple and the book works with datasets that are almost complete, clean, and without entry mistakes (something that NEVER happens in real life). Nevertheless, I believe that the code provided can be translated to real-world situations (I have done it myself for Naive Bayes and K-means, at least.).Things that could improve the book:1 - A mathematical appendix that fleshes out some more complicated algorithms.2 - Exercises at the end of each chapter.3 - More examples.Overall, I think the book is pretty good and enjoyable."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this book as a go-to manual that guides me step-by-step in implementing different machine learning techniques. It has a ton of ready code you can use in R. The author explains very well the logic of each technique and this is very helpful to decide what technique to use depending on the nature of the problem you explore.  The book is non-mathematical but it contains references if you want to dig into the math behind the algorithms which I do every now and then even though I come from the humanities (sociology) and business (MBA). I think it is a great book, easy to understand and teaches a lot of very practical skills. I hope the author updates regularly the book with new editions as the techniques and the algorithms evolve over time."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm torn. There are some useful gems in this book, and for the most part, the presentation is simple, albeit a bit pedantic and cartoonish at times. If I was trying to get up to snuff on a new machine learning method, I might start here, since it *does* provide starter code for a variety of problems. That's quite handy. It doesn't, however, go into much depth at all on any one topic. You can't read this book and expect to know how to do any one of these methods well. Certainly, it's a tall order to ask any one book to cover all ML topics in depth, but any potential reader should be aware that this just skims the surface of a whole bunch of topics.On top of this, who in the world edited this book? Every other page has horrible typos, missing words, repeated sentences. These are not trivial errors either. This is a book about data analysis and yet the reported data are clearly wrong in places, e.g., a result is listed as .06 percent in one spot and then .0006 in another (p. 271). Basic subject-verb agreement errors riddle the text, e.g. ""These output is shown as follows"". Sometimes these are trivial errors, but other times you have absolutely no idea what the intended meaning is. I have about 100 pages more to read but I'm starting to wonder if I'm just wasting my time."

It would also help to know some linear algebra or set theory. If you have at least a Bachelors in Mathematics you'll be able to follow this book easily.

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased two Packt publications on AI and ML. Both are extremely poorly written, poorly researched and extremely difficult to follow. Language, terms, descriptions and content are difficult to follow at best, or archaic at worst. Nothing is explained and require additional research at almost every step. Screenshots sizes are inconsistent, do not add value and in many cases are blown up to an extent where screenshot fonts well exceeds the book print. This gives the impression images are added to maximize uptake of the book print real estate. In some cases, you have to work out that some instructions are included in screenshots, rather than within the actual text. I have come to the conclusion that Packt publications are no more than résumé fillers for their authors. The publication includes no references. I learned more from YouTube videos. Beware of catchy one liners such as 'A Comprehensive Guide to Building Intelligent Apps for Python Beginners and Developers'. This is nothing more than bait. The book is an insult to the word 'comprehensive', and the best use python beginners may make of this publication is to send it back immediately for a refund and look for an academic and referenced text - Item not as described."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must have book for ml practioners
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing book .. best for machine learning beginner
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best book for intermediators.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book takes a different approach to teaching ML. Instead of focusing on just concepts, practical hands-on experience is given more priority. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros:1. Great laid out content.2. Example-based approach.3. Lots of projects to do.4. Teaches how to build a ML model instead of focusing on the underlying concepts only.Cons:1. Little short of concepts, actually.This book serves a great deal. But still you should know about Py-dependencies like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib etc. which are explained in O'Reilly's Data Science Handbook quite well.To learn python, I would suggest going for free resources at Udacity, CodeAcademy or even some of O'Reilly's free eBooks.Sometimes you might not understand a particular implementation. In those cases having a little conceptual background helps. I suggest going for Ian Goodfellow's Deep Learning book which can be grabbed for nothing from GitHub. This book explains the concepts immensely well.Thank You."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,By far the most complete and accurate hands-on book on machine learning and deep learning. Author has done a remarkable job in giving details in just the right amount. No over-doing or under-doing in this one. Code given in the jupyter notebooks works like a charm and covers almost everything. Highly Recommended!!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comprehensive. Guides one meticulously through the basics of Machine Learning to more advanced topics and Deep Learning. Ample examples to try out. Excellent mix and balance of theory and working code.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best books I've read on the topic. The right mix of theory and programming.The breadth could've been  better. Nevertheless, great book. Lucid explanations.- Coming from an ML practitioner and someone who has read 20+ books on the ML."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful introduction to the 5 schools of Machine Learning ! Easily understandable even by a layman :-)
,2.0 out of 5 stars,The book is too slow and super boring. I wish it came straight to the point.Please don't judge the book by its cover.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent book to understand the nuances of a complex subject. Great book for beginners.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Paper quality is  not good and font is too small and difficult to read

,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good coverage of contents
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Etudes universitaires ingénieur civil UCL Belgique
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The title of this book is misleading. It is a comprehensive Machine Learning Book. The chapters on Support Vector Machines are the best I have found. I found the treatment of Information Theoritic learning models very useful.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this book to get an up to date view of machine learning and though heavily mathematical this book is certainly worth the effort in areas that take your fancy.I especially like the way Haykin shows how classical ideas e.g. eigenvector decomposition fit within a neural framework - principle component analysis by a single neuron.My reason for only giving 4 stars is the lack of actual examples. The Lena pictures were very instructive, more of these types of real world examples would be useful.I still have lots more to read so may post an update later."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,great book.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,A good textbook for understand more about learning machine by Neural Networks. The Haykin text is a 'must have' for everyone studying this kind of theoretical approach.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great reference/text for machine learning with a deep mathematical treatment of the subject. It also presents many computational examples. Highly recommended for graduate students with good mathematical background.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book has been shipped in less time than expected; I've bought it on sunday and been delivered on friday. The cover is slightly worn due to the travel, but considering the price and the shipping times I really don't care at all. Fully satisfied :) 5 stars"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought this book 3 or 4 years ago, but wasn't able to appreciate the content simply because I wasn't ready for that level. It's not a hands-on ML manual, it doesn't have ""let's do dropout because it proved to be useful and looks like it works like brain neurons"" either. It is very dry but very comprehensive mathematical introduction into ML, although it's a bit old (for example it suggest to use hyperbolic tangent, but nowadays it's well-known that ReLU less prone to saturation). If you need a book with answers on ""WHY"" it's a right book, if you need a book with answers to ""HOW"" you better find something else."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great textbook for graduate students. Broad overview and introduction to many relevant machine learning approaches in use or study today. Deep enough to enable the student to follow what prominent researchers have been publishing about machine learning in journals like Nature or Science in the last 5 years.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Haykin is a well known author in this subspecialty and the content of the book seems fine, but it hasn't been updated much from the 2nd edition despite progress in the field.  I did fine in a course using the book entirely off a 2nd edition copy and kept this 3e text mostly closed for resale value. The only things I had to note were In chapter 2 it has some updates largely regarding the prevailing Bayesian views and in chapter 8 the problems expanded (old 8.06 is 8.10).  As far as presentation, things were done well if sometimes dry (the latter likely because this isn't my area). The required mathematics is presented without tedious re-explanation, but if you aren't prepared for it you might not understand much."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,La moitié des pages sont coupées!J'espere le change de livre oú refunding!
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a really good textbook, but the index is pretty much useless - I don't know how it was generated but it leaves out lots of key topics. This, along with a sparse table of contents and vague chapter headings, means that the book is difficult to use as a reference work. I have the Indian edition, and I'm not sure if this also applies to others."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pessimo pessimo pessimo. Non so cosa sia saltato in mente all'editore di effettuare una revisione del genere. Tale revisione consiste in un cambio di copertina (ora il libro sembra un testo delle scuole elementari), nonchè nel taglio della prefazione, della conclusione e della tavola dei contenuti (indice esteso), che per un libro di quasi 1100 pagine è un elemento assolutamente essenziale. Proprio non capisco perchè abbiano voluto dilaniare in questo modo un testo fantastico. Personalmente lo sto restituendo grazie all'opportunità di recesso offerta da amazon e sto ordinando la versione precedente, disponibile presso i venditori esterni."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank you
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Given how popular this textbook is, I will skip the description.I expected this book to be lacking some of the contents of the international edition, given that it costs the fraction of the other's price.Instead, the book is complete, the chapters are numbered and even contains the last few chapters (Philosophical Foundations of AI, Present and Future of AI) that were missing from the 2009 Indian edition (according to another review I read on amazon). It appears to me to be just the same as the International Edition.The pages are somewhat thin, but still of a much better quality than I expected for the price, and very common for books this big."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have not finished reading every chapter but the far that I have read, I have learned quite a lot. It seems to deliver some decent foundational understanding of the topic at hand. However, the paperback print feels weak and it seems like hardcover is only available on amazon.com, not amazon.co.jp.Anyway, I hope to be back with a more detailed review after a year or so :)"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Dieses Buch wird gerne auch als DAS Buch über KI bezeichnet. Die Inhalte sind klar strukturiert und wahrscheinlich für die meisten Leute etwas ""trocken"", wobei man bedenken muss, dass es nun mal ein theoretisches Buch ist. Der Artikel ist wohlgemerkt die internationale Version (bei mir indisch). Das Buch ist trotzdem die originale englische Fassung, ich habe bisher keine Mängel finden können. Lediglich das Cover war in einer Ecke etwas angestoßen, was bei dem Preis im Gegensatz zum Original wohl vertretbar ist.Versandt wurde der Artikel per DHL Express. Daher war es sehr schnell aus Indien bei mir."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,私は本来門外漢ですが、同分野の基本を学習中、講師により指定されていた図書として購入しました。比較的網羅的に枠組みを知ることができるという印象です。（理解が十分かは別として。必要な基礎は別に学習する必要があると思われます。）他のレビュアーのいう「専門家」でなくても、わくわくしながら読み進める本として推薦します。
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"El libro es perfecto salvo que es de tapa blanda, y con el peso de las 1000 páginas que tiene es muy fácil que se doble. Sería mejor una tapa rígida, aunque sume un poco más de peso."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,At first. I am rewriting review for this book. This books covers fundamental theory about ML. So I was very frustracted because lack of mathmetical background. But once you get use to it. This book will be definite guide book for ML study. Admitting..this book is hard to read. but worth it. and can't be easier because ML itself is VERY hard topic !!!
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not think for a second that this is an introductory book. The mathematics are insanely complex, and near as I can tell, there is no code covered. This is a book on university (possibly post grad) mathematics. I would not even consider this computer science."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This looks like a very nice text, but the figures are badly done: in particular, items on them (scatter points, labels, ticks) are unacceptably small. What probably happened (speaking from experience of having done similar things) was that the author made larger plot which were than shrunk by the editor to fit on the page. The size of the labels and datapoints should've been adjusted to anticipate for the shrinkage."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clearly written.  Shows the theory and practice of machine learning.  An invaluable tutorial.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,The fundamentals of learning algorithms are presented in a structured way that enhanced my understanding of the topics without seeming redundant.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast shipping, the person I purchased this for loved it"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this book to learn on my own but is very much written as a companion to a course. It is a very dense coverage of technical details of machine learning. I am taking a machine learning course in the spring and will update as to how it helps in the classroom.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Item as described, fast delivery, thanks."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,great
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is an excellent introduction to machine learning complete with the math necessary to understand the subject area. I highly recommend it.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book covers the machine learning waterfront.  Recommended.  One of the best features is that the authors are very responsive to any questions, and provide very helpful guidance."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Anirudh Koul and his co-author have created an easy to navigate, well written and logically structured How-To book on the latest in AI. Anyone can benefit from the novice to the CS student to the CAO and CTO. I recommend it strongly."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Will detail it on completing, so far I find it very interesting!!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,👍very good reference book for data lovers
,2.0 out of 5 stars,outdated and lacking outside common knowledge
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Printed on a cheap paper, in this condition it shouldn't cost more than 10 dollars. Paid 56$ for foggy images and extremely low quality print on a rough paper.Will provide feedback on the quality of the content, but clearly disappointing from the first impression."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really liked very practical knowledge that I got from this book. It's easy to read and ery insightful at the same time.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can honestly say that I didn’t enjoy this book. It’s important to read, I learnt loads, but it’s not enjoyable. I felt my blood pressure rising as I read it and found myself getting more and more annoyed. How, in these modern times, are women still so overlooked? I’d recommend this book to everyone, and indeed I have!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I saw this book being advertised at my local train station and for a long while I told myself that I needed to purchase it. Now, having read it cover to cover I am so glad that I did. The data information in it is absolutely astonishing and what that reveals is even more mesmerising. From realising that snow clearing CAN be sexist to understanding the power women can have  when they come together has been eye opening, provoking and last but not least liberating. Knowledge definitely is power and every woman or man should read this book if they want to have a better understanding of how biological sex and gender roles continue to shape the word we are living in today. Buy it, read it , take action!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Punchy, comprehensive and very well researched.  Every man should read it and learn.  Every woman should read it and say 'I told you so...'"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really well written, super accessible for a non academic audience and all backed up with excellent research and facts you can share to back up your arguments when trying to make change in your life. You’ll spend the first 30 pages gasping at how ridiculously unfair the world is and how you hadn’t noticed!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The nuances, the subtleties, the ahaa moments, the this is not fair deep breaths, the wow I didn’t know that choruses, the I must do something to change things resolutions.Great write up. Just know Caroline, that the data gap is slightly worse than you thought in some places. Let’s do more and write more."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave this book as a present. The person who got it says this has helped them understand why so many aspects of the world supposed to be ""generic"" are actually more tailored towards men. Mainly, it is because makers and advertisers often regard men as the norm, consciously or unconsciously."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this book after seeing the author on telly, but unable to get into reading this. Have picked it up a few times but so far there is always a distraction. Maybe doing it a disservice by only giving it three stars, but as an avid reader I normally can't put the books i buy down."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Invisible Women is loaded with research, and even so, it is heartbreaking that so little change is made on a national level by governments worldwide.Comprehensive insight into the daily struggles of women globally that as a white, middle class woman, I didn't have an idea about. You can definitely learn about your own privilege, but also get shocked how these limitations imposed on women impact your own privileged life.It's a call to arms! It's a call to change and a very pragmatic one."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book has been extensively reviewed so there's little I can add but my agreement that this is an important and timely book. It is a tremendous weapon in our arsenal against all those who claim that feminism is no longer needed.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Recommended to me by a friend. I work in the data industry so really appreciated the use of journal articles and academic research. One thing I would say against it is that the author writes in a tone that very woman should be a mother which I think is becoming very outdated.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best books on Data Science with practical examples, data sets and solutions..."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best books on this subject matter. I am beginner , i didnt found this intimidating or tough to understand. Language and cocepts are easy to grasp."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect book to understand fundamentals for machine learning
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Of all the machine learning books I have read to date, I have found this book the most digestible.I like the way the book is structured: information-based learning, similarity-based learning, probability-based learning, error-based learning.Each chapter includes exercises that help reinforce learning but are enjoyable to tackle at the same time.The case studies provide further insights and reinforce the applied approach the book takes to understanding machine learning for predictive analytics."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well packed. One of the most amazing, informative, and comprehensive machine learning books. Presents information in a great way and well structured with great case studiesHighly recommended!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Muy buen libro para iniciar en el tema de ML. Principalmente el área de prediccion Matemáticas simples

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sin duda alguna, el pilar fundamental para construir cualquier base de conocimientos sobre el reinforcement learning. Aunque tuve algún problema para decepcionar el envío, diría que fue más bien provocado por el repartidor."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thanks the authors to wrote this book. I learned a lot of things behind Machine Learning with Dynamics 365 and Power Platform. Happy to see that Vinnie and Aurelien combined the 2 worlds to learn how to use it in real world with Business Applications. With business cases and deep dive technical ML understand, I will really recommended it to buy - especially if you are a newbie on this topic like me. Wonderful preface and afterword , globally it’s really a great book that I will forward to my company."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,Die Druckqualität finde ich leider sehr schlecht. Sehr dünnes Papier mit verwischtem verschwommenem Druck. Teilweise sind auch geknickte Seiten bedruckt. Inhalt wie erwartet. Nur leider lässt es sich sehr schwer lesen (Druckqualität!)
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Il libro è ottimo come contenuti teorici per RL. E' però arrivato leggermente danneggiato.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Uno dei migliori libri su cui studiare questo ramo del machine learning
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Il miglior libro sull'argomento, completo e veramente dettagliato. La copertina rigida è un plus non da poco spesso non disponibile nei libri universitari."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,I am using this book to teach myself the subject and it definitely does the job for me. It probably has no competitors in the category of books which deal with reinforcement learning in a non formal way. I appreciate the intuitive insights that the text provides into algorithms and definitions of RL. At times though I find the book too verbose with unnecessary repetitions which can confuse the message. Some maths oriented minds (like me) could prefer a more formal and more compact presentation.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is highly recommended and cited book and it really worth reading if you are interested in RL. Nice in-depth explanations as well as exercises. In addition, it is nice that it is a hardcover."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really excited when I found this book on Amazon. It seemed like the perfect source to get up to speed with some of Microsoft's new Azure machine learning tools - especially since I am starting a new role at work where I'll be using a lot of these tools.I was ready to give up after the first chapter. It felt like most of it was excerpts from Wikipedia. Also, a lot of the content was wrong! For example, when you have outliers in a dataset, the common practice is to reject them, not ""impute alternate values."" Where are these ""alternate values"" coming from if the outlier was obviously outside the expected range? Reading the first chapter felt like reading a term paper about ML written by a college sophomore.I did try to press on, though. I thought, well, the author is more of an expert on applying Microsoft tools than the theory of ML so I'll give the part of the book that is the reason I bought the book in the first place a chance. Sadly, it was no better. It felt like a cobbled together collection of marketing speak about Azure. A lot of times, the sentences didn't even make sense. Plus, the author would talk about an API and then say, this API was deprecated by Microsoft so let's talk about what replaced it. Why talk about the deprecated API at all? It just makes the book confusing.I finally had to admit to myself that, even though I dropped nearly $50 on this book, wasting my time trying to read it was an even greater waste of money.Bottom line: Don't bother with this book. You'll get much more value from the Microsoft Learn learning paths...and they're free!"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was pleasantly surprised that despite the textbook amount of examples and details the book was easy to follow and had plenty of depth to the sections on business economics and the statistic behind it. My only complaint is the section for machine learning, AI and neural networks is a little higher level than I was hoping. It does a good job with some examples as well as a mid/high-level approach. If you are looking for a deep dive into these topics as I was you will be a little disappointed and will need some supplemental material for that."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Positives: The seller responded well, answered all the queries.Negatives: The print quality is terrible. The ink is super light and caused me a headache while reading. I've attached a photo for your reference comparing it with the first edition of the book."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,The book is amazing. Just buy it. Amazon’s handling of the book was really poor. It arrived with mold and stains in the book’s cover
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good introduction to RL
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Covering a lot of statistics, with snippets of R code and a touch of Python, you will get a good overview of business oriented data science in this book. A caution - if you are not reasonably strong on your stats before you dive into this book, you will quickly become befuddled. I've got 12+ credit hours of stats and found the book a challenge. Having said that, it covers the basics well and touches on pretty much everything from simple linear regression to machine learning and AI. If this is your discipline, it's a good intro."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"""Business Data Science: Combining Machine Learning and Economics to Optimize, Automate, and Accelerate Business Decisions"" by Matt Taddy is well presented. The ideas and concepts are easy to follow with good flow. I'm giving an extra star for easy to read text and graphics. I wouldn't say this is an accessible read. It is clearly meant for those who actually use data in a scientific manner. That said, the author does a good job of presenting the topic in a clear and concise manner."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,I'm fairly new to data science but I'm always looking for new books to learn more on it from different angles. I like that this book has the obvious business twist which shows real applications for data science. It's not the most exciting or cool looking book (very old school looking and feeling too) but still enjoyed skimming through it
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an extraordinarily good text that is utterly comprehensive in giving you everything you need to know about the science of Big Data.  What is also amazing is that such a comprehensive text is priced so inexpensively!  As far as I am concerned this is the greatest value for your hard-earned dollar of any book published in the past 12 months.  My headline says it all:  Seminal.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very useful for managers or others responsible for implementation oversight. This provides a solid introduction and overview with in depth examples and explanations. Not exactly the most exciting topic but well organized and relatively reader friendly.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Many books like this usually miss the target of being practice and useful for 'business', but this one does a very good job of weaving the various concepts and ideas together."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic book that covers most of the major machine learning algorithms with a great teaching approach that builds good programming habits. This book is chock-full of helpful tips and good practices to make you a productive machine learning analyst.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fake book provided by Amazon.They are cheating there customers.All images and charts are black and white.Its just fake print of the book
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good read, easy to follow."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are looking for a theoretical rigorous ML book, then this one is not for you. I found this book useful when I quickly went through all the chapters in couples days. It is more about ""how to use R to build basic ML models and the details/tricks that might be useful in practice""."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good book. Was a required book for a masters level class in data analytics program I am in. Easy to read and follow. My professor?? He was a different story. Lol.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A great compilation of different machine learning algorithms , implemented and explained with R code that made this book a great acquisition for me, I thoroughly enjoyed it . If you're looking for an introduction to machine learning with R this book is great . However , the book really doesn't go into much depth on the theory or into more complicated examples and algorithms. Hopefully other books will cover. They should do an advanced version of this."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent book. It covers all you need to get started with a solid foundation in machine learning. I would highly recommend it to any programmer (or reasonably logically minded individual) who wants to get into machine learning.EDIT: After finishing the book, I'd still recommend it, and everything I wrote previously still applies. I am now actively using the knowledge I gained from this book on a project. However, I am reducing my rating to 4 stars because the publisher/editor is absolutely atrocious. I found at least a dozen minor errors (mostly typographical such as repeating a section of a sentence) that never should have made it past a simple proofreading."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clearly and well written, with logical step-by-step introduction to the various topics, and good explanations of the relevant libraries, their strengths and weaknesses, and then useful application to specific examples."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have completed first 3 chapters, its an easy book, author tried hard to make everything explain in simple english, rather than going deeper into maths. This book does provide intuition to lot of deeplearning concepts. Very good book indeed. Thanks for writing it."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The book in terms of content is great. But as has been pointed out by many readers above, it clearly seems to be a fake book ( re-printed by the seller by photocopying the original ). It is in black and white, and there was no code given to register for the free online e-book. Even if there was, it seems to not be working as per other reviewers. If you're planning to buy in 2020 or later, I'd suggest wait for the second edition and then purchase from Manning publication's official website."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,I tried to register the book online to get free e book. The codes given in the book aren't accepted by the registration website.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very Good book, especially on the use of pretrained models like inception net, vgg, etc.The language used is very simple. Presentation of topics is well organised. It is very interesting to read with a computer by your side to practice the programming. Codes can be downloaded, of course.Expects some familiarity with tensorflow and keras. A working knowledge of python is also necessary.It is not a book for beginners."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,The book itself is well written and helps you to hit the ground running by abstracting the math behind the subject.  I would rate the book 5star.My rating on this review is for the copy of the book. The Manning publication allows you to register and download the ebook. The codes are missing in this copy. It looks like a reprint. I own other Manning publication books and this book doesn't match the quality of those books.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book has great content for learners who wants to grasp about Deep Learning. It is well structured and easy to understand. Even if you don't have strong background on Machine Learning, you can read this book to understand things. Highly recommended for both students and practitioners."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not able to download the ebook, printed copy provided...amazon look into it"
,2.0 out of 5 stars,The just received the book and noticed that book is  black and white from inside.  This was a big disappointment for me. Though the cost was just Rs 530/-. The fact should have been mentioned in the description by seller. So that customer may have knowledge of it before hand and accordingly buying decision could have been made.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book's preface says that first part of the book is to introduce the mathematical prerequisites for people from CS background. Usually people studying CS know how to write code but machine learning involves certain kind of math which does not come naturally to most of the computer science students and most of the books dedicate just one or two chapters to introduce those basic concepts, which in my limited experience are not enough. The first part of this book (I believe the first 7-8 chapters) are dedicated to carefully explaining all the theoretical underpinning of Bayesian analysis, graphical models and machine learning. This is the hardest part to cracking machine learning for anyone and I feel this book does a great job at that. Not to mention the examples in the book are really fun and engaging."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad rating is for the print quality of paper back version. Print quality is worse than xerox copy quality. Did not expect Cambridge press to go with such worst quality of print.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good amount of topics covered.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Python programmer for quite some time now and have been using Python for Machine Learning. Having been a C++ programmer, I was looking for a book that would help me understand how to use C++ for Machine Learning. This book came in at the right time to help me.The book is very well structured with the author clearly setting the tone of the book from the first chapter itself. This book is for people who understand and have reasonable experience in C++. The first chapter gives a good overview of Linear Regression which is one of the basic algorithms used in ML. Chapter 2 explains how to store and process data using data stored in different file formats which is very essential for training and testing of models. The third chapter introduces performance metrics and explains terms like overfitting and underfitting. It also helps us to understand bias and variance characteristics. The second section of this chapter shows how to implement different well-known machine learning models/algorithms like clustering, anomaly detection etc. Chapters 4 to 9 cover these algorithms in greater detail. Chapters 10 and Chapter 11 cover Neural Networks and Sentiment Analysis very nicely. Chapter 12 and Chapter 13 cover the issues that might come up during production deployment and how to overcome the same.What I liked about the book: For every chapter, the author has covered the right amount of theory first before beginning with the C++ implementation. This helps newbie's like me to understand and follow the concept better. At the end of each chapter, the Further Reading Section helped me a lot as I know what to read to get a better understanding of the topic. This one was really helpful. Also, complete examples have been used to explain the algorithms being used which is very helpful.Areas of Improvement: I would have really liked if after every chapter there were a few practise questions that the reader can practise. This would have ensured that the newbie like me has a good grasp of the current chapter before moving on to the next one."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"While Python normally does the job just fine when it comes to handling ML and more general analytics tasks, I have wanted for a long time to work on these kinds of problems using C++.  Unfortunately, it has been very difficult to get started because of a severe lack of educational resources out there.  Luckily, this book has finally filled that gap for me.What I really like about the book is that the author has put together a series of very complete examples for each method being discussed.  Every program reads in an actual csv file with the data (as opposed to using some form of random number generation to create a toy example), puts it into the right format to be used with the given implementation of an ML method and then puts together a data set that one can use as output.  As someone who has not had much experience with C++ outside a classroom setting, I found this extremely helpful, and it has made the material immediately applicable to my work in real life.The book covers just the right amount of theory in each chapter as well before diving into the C++ implementation, making the material accessible to developers who are relatively new to data science (which, as I understand, is actually the main target audience)."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Was delivered on time. No doubt this is one of the easy to read books with nice coverage. It accompanies a toolbox which gives an idea of implementations. This is not as heavy (in number of pages or readability) as Machine Learning a Probabilisitc Perspective by Kevin P. Murphy or Probabilisitic Graphical Model by Daphne Koller (BTW these are excellent books too but with different expectations from the reader). Concentration inequalities or bounding error in some settings like stuff is missing but that mostly is not a part of standard bayesian toolbox (IKD maybe PAC-Bayes).

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll be frank and concise.So far I've read the 4 first chapters (graphic models), and the amount of typos is annoying. Fortunately, the author keeps a free online corrected version.  I'm marvelled at how Cambridge University Press is not ashamed of selling a book this expensive with so many typos. They've had almost 10 years to correct them, and I've just bought a book in 2020 with all the typos, so far.The language used by the author sometimes is not as precise as I would like, leaving space for dubious interpretation, and then adding to this the occasional error, and one may conclude that our learning experience is less than ideal. The abundance of examples tries to compensate for his imprecise language, and sometimes it breaks the reading flow... however, they very interesting, and some even fun.The physical quality of the book is remarkable, the paper, the colours... the feeling when I touch it. The font size could be increased a bit, since overall it's not that big to start with, and then the remarks are made with an even smaller font size.I'll update as I progress on my self-study."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great work on Bayesian machine learning with a full software base for support. The author goes beyond only defining techniques  by actually explaining some small details and consequences of math definitions which you won’t find in other textbooks. The organization of the book contents and different short courses are super helpful. The hardcover print is of great quality. But there is something odd: the whole book is printed in grayscale. Then there is small color printed addendum in the middle of the book with the color figures. But since there are only few figures which require color for understanding this does not really bother.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First its awesome that the author &CUP have provided free PDF of the complete book. Only after looking through the contents, i decided to buy it for my personal library. Prof. Barber has done a great job in introducing probabilistic concepts and putting forth more advanced and interesting techniques. Plus there are many examples throughout the book along with MATLAB codes which really helps a reader. The code is organized as a toolbox of functions with demos for each chapter.Especially for me who has very little background in machine learning this is a self-use textbook. I am still reading the earlier chapters and can recommend it as a reading for graduate and PhD students.Though CUP could have made further corrections to the book. Reading and consulting errata is becoming bothersome too. I hope they rectify it as soon as possible. But apart from this, the book is top notch !!!"

This leaves the 'C' languages without a comparable foothold in this arena until this book was published. This book covers the gaping void between the 'C' language trained programmers and the Python Machine Language world. It has the same  mathematical introduction theory, but counters with a set of code libraries that work with C++.This book will allow the C++ programmer to expand his programming scope without having to rewrite his entire code base in Python and learn a whole new programming language. Not only will it save enormous amounts of time, but it will also provide and give usage detail for a compatible  PyTorch Deep Learning library for C++code  use. Now the  high performance world of GPU programming is available with a tensor interface to C++ programmers."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In a world where data continues exponential growth trajectory one needs to be able to make sense of the data. Many times people take data visualizations and statistical reports at face value. If only there was a book to help people cut through the noise of Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. The book “Becoming A Data Head” is that book that helps readers cut through the noise and hype of these new realms of leveraging data!The book provides tools and details on how readers can better understand the merits of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and overall use of data. There are also chapters on probabilities, statistics, and regression equations that help set the foundation for the more advance methodologies. I love how the authors break down these complex ideas so that readers can be skeptical and challenge assumptions. In addition readers will know how to ask better questions at the start of a project, so that the data analytics project will provide meaningful results.This book will help people work more efficiently with data scientists and communicate the problems they are trying to solve with data available to them. I highly recommend this book for anyone that wants to improve their understanding of data and the methods that can be used to analyze data sets."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First and foremost, I know the main author well, and I'm happy to see this book finally ""hit the shelves"". It's a book I would've greatly appreciated as an undergrad in statistics (or even graduate school for that matter), as it discusses a lot of practical aspects about being a good data scientist that my old formula-heavy stats and consulting books tended to gloss over. The authors have a natural talent in explaining complex topics to non-technical audience without all the fluff, and have obviously put a lot of thought into the examples used throughout the book (just take a look at the deep learning chapter!). The book covers a lot of important ground and the material is presented well. I think practitioners, whether in academia or industry, will especially appreciate the chapter on common pitfalls, which highlights several common problems we often run into in applied work. Parts I and II of the  book (Thinking/Speaking like a Data Head) will help build skills that are critical to applied data science (e.g., asking the right questions and thinking  about variation).  Whether you're an experienced data scientist, or just getting started, I wholeheartedly recommend this  book to you."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This book reads like an angry TA's notebook with no regard for the reader understanding the contents (full of ""…it is obvious that…"" and ""…it follows that…""). I found myself wishing I could raise my hand to ask to explain the examples! In many situations the author brings in seemingly random theorems, attempts to tie them together, and then goes on to use the result without any rigorous proof of the underlying math or the theorems true applicability. It almost feels like the author is begging the question. I understand that, given the breadth of the literature covered, only so much can be said for each topic but the praise this book receives is quite undeserved.Haykin uses the XOR problem as an example ad nauseam. I realize it's a canonical ANN classification problem; however in later chapters,  it's annoying and frustrating when an ANN gets explained in such simple terms but a more complicated classification problem gets a paragraph or two and then a bunch of pictures with no explanation of how to derive the ANN to solve the problem. Detail a ""real"" problem, or just drop the examples because I can make graphs myself!Couple this book with a poor lecturer and a student is likely to never pursue ANNs again. The only value I have found in this book is the extensive bibliography. I recommend finding a website that has grouped all Biblio references per chapter and then start hunting down the source articles. You will have to do this anyway to keep up with the author."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is absolutely terrible. It is being used as a graduate level text in neural networks and it is perhaps one of the most abysmally written textbooks ever. The chapter problems are completely out of scope given the material presented and even the solutions manual is poorly written, incomplete, and presented with little or no explanation at all. Many of the solutions do not even answer the questions that they are associated with. The text relies very heavily on esoteric mathematics that are not even remotely explained nor are references even provided to provide foundation. Very few examples are provided throughout the text and the material is nearly impossible to follow."

First off, the reader/purchaser would have to already have extensive expertise in the subject matter (I really like the Kalman Filter coverage).

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm probably to be considered a ""very advanced amateur"" or ""informal professional"" in machine learning techniques. I never studied them in school, but I presently make a living in part by coding up new ones and coming up with ML solutions for commercial problems. Confronting the field for the first time, I wondered how people learned the stuff. Most of the introductory texts just covered neural nets ... and very very badly. Neural nets are still useful, and probably the most mature of machine learning techniques, but throwing them at a beginner without context is a recipe for confusion and dismay.This text, by contrast, barely mentions them, and puts them in their proper context for the beginner. The right way to think about machine learning is starting with *very* basic statistical techniques and probability theory, and building up from there into simple classification and scoring systems, and then on to the rest of the field. The author of this text does it the right way.One of the difficulties of didactic texts in the subject is ... machine learning is a very diverse field. All kinds of gizmos are helpful, and there isn't an obvious taxonomy, as there is in, say, linear time series models. The author takes a very high level view; breaking the field down into geometric, probabilistic and ""logical"" models. I believe this to be original, and a very powerful way of looking at things for the beginner.The progression is well thought out, and each chapter comes with a useful summary and references (one of which has already proved helpful to me) for further reading. The summaries are not mere recitations; they contain useful facts about the strengths and weaknesses of different varieties of models covered, as well as deep insights that are buried beneath useless verbiage and equations in other texts. There are things covered here which are covered in precious few advanced texts: for example, inductive concept learning seemed to fall off the map after the ""AI winter,"" at least as far as most texts were concerned. The book also manages to take the reader to fairly complex topics: boosting, bagging, lasso, meta-learning and random forests. The last chapter has useful guidance on out of scope topics (reinforcement learning, sequence prediction, etc).The text is well written and has attractive and helpful graphs and figures. Better yet, the layout, color scheme and typesetting is the best I have ever seen in a book of this kind. This seems like a small thing, but far too many color texts end up looking like old school wired magazines: they hurt the eyes with useless graphics and insane colors. Just because you have a broad palette doesn't mean you should use all those colors. The typesetter gets this one just right. I commend the author on his eye for beauty here.Downsides: as a unifying didactic text for beginners (or review for non-beginners), it is near perfect, but it does lack problem sets. For me, this is a feature, rather than a bug, but people teaching from this book might find it tedious to come up with problems which go with the text. Perhaps sticking some online would be appropriate at some point."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"In my Advanced Statistics class one of the text books was   The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition          . I found some of the chapters in this book heavy going and I had to read them several times and ask the professor lots of questions before I understood the material.In contrast, Machine Learning by Peter Flach is a very well written, very gentle introduction to machine learning algorithms. Prof. Flach writes that he spent four years writing this book and it shows in the care with which the material is presented.The mathematics used is algebra, exponents, summations, products and a bit of linear algebra.  There are only a few places where derivatives are used (as it turns out, basic linear algebra can be used to describe many machine learning algorithms). The level of the Machine Learning makes it appropriate for an undergraduate Machine Learning course.Machine Learning covers most of the core algorithms in machine learning. Of necessity what is provided is an overview of topics like linear regression and linear classifiers like Support Vector Machines. These are topics that are covered in depth in book like   Applied Regression Analysis           and   An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods          .Reading this book without taking a class in machine learning can be difficult because there are no exercises with solutions or projects with data. Machine learning is a practical art. It is very difficult to read a ~360 page book and absorb all of the material without the reinforcement of applying the machine learning techniques. As I read the book I constantly wished that the author had included exercises with the associated data on his web site for the major approaches.  This would also make the book easier to use for a machine learning course, since the professor would not have to develop all of the homework exercises."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Flach provides you with a very readable and concise book that covers several vast fields of computation. The subject is big data, to use a recent trendy label. He provides a clear narrative, where you can quickly understand the key underlying ideas. Amusingly, the first chapter has a long example about how to distinguish spam [unwanted bulk mail] from ham [regular mail]. A good pedagogic choice, for you learn about conditional probabilities and Bayes classification. It turns out that Bayesian approaches are common in the entire field of machine learning. So the first chapter correctly confronts this point and educates the reader.I would also point you to Figure 1.7. It is a qualitative 2 dimensional map of the models treated in the text. Models sharing characteristics are close together in the map. You get a top level qualitative appreciation of their properties. Useful when making decisions which to apply.The text also talks about a common problem when dealing with high dimensional data - the curse of dimensionality. As the number of dimensions increases, the data gets sparser. Ideally you want the data to be on a manifold - a surface of lower dimensionality unto which you can project the data prior to further analysis. Of course this just begs the question about how you can detect such a manifold. The book really doesn't say much further other than perhaps to look at a histogram of pairwise distances from a sampling.The section on support vector machines is especially nicely written. It cuts through a lot of jargon that exists in this topic. The geometric visualisation of what you are trying to find - a hyperplane that separates the data into 2 qualitatively different sections - is the main idea to keep in mind."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book defines machine learning as programs that learn from experience, but it focuses mostly on data mining.  There is a two-page nod to all the other kinds of machine learning, such as all the reinforcement learning work.  I'd prefer data mining to be called data mining. However, this is a good first book on data mining.Machine Learning first talks about the tasks and output of machine learning.  Author Peter Flach surveys the various types of models: Tree models (e.g., decision trees), rule models, linear models (e.g., regression and SVM), distance-based models (e.g., k Means), and probabilistic models.  He covers all the Usual Suspects, with no surprises.  He ends with a discussion of features and a little coverage of ensemble methods.  There aren't a ton of references, but the bibliography is reasonably long.The methods are presented with the math in matrix algebra form, which I like, and with a high-level algorithm in pseudocode.  The book is well illustrated. It would be nice if it contained more discussion of how to know when to believe the resulting model, how to judge quality."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,・ドラフト版（2018年2月ぐらいのもの）のパート2までほとんど読み切っていたので購入しました（最後のパート3はほとんどが神経科学や応用のお話です）．ざっと見てはドラフト版と大きくは変わっていないようです．・基本的な方針・雰囲気は初版と同じで図と文章での説明が中心ですが，数式が若干増えたかもしれません．適格度トレースの説明は若干分かりにくくなったかも．・英語は若干まどろっこしい感じがあって，コード本ほどスラスラとは読めない感じがしました．・数式の展開・擬似コードの記述は初版と同じく丁寧で分かりやすいと思います．・タイトルの通り，深層強化学習について直接触れているわけではありません，が，関数近似のパートを読むと，何故近年の深層強化学習においてベルマン方程式に基づくTDバックアップが直接は行われず，SGDを用いているかについて知見が得られるなど，近年の研究のモチベーションを理解するのに役立ちます（他には，ツリーバックアップを見れば，TRPOのVineに対して自然に理解できるようになります）．また，n-stepバックアップ（A3Cで使用）・適格度トレース（PPOで使用されていたような…）についてやさしく説明している本が他にあまり見当たらないのでそこも貴重です．・TD学習の収束性の証明について，一応触れられているものの一箇所論文任せになっています．・方策ベースの方法，特にアクタークリティックに関してはもう少し詳しく説明があっても良かったかも．また，方策勾配定理の証明は割引率γ=1のケースのみですが，Webで探せば一般的なケースのものも見つかります．・個人的に，初版でイマイチ歯切れが悪かったように感じた箇所はかなりカットされています．

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle version: images are too small.This is particularly bad for special chars and formulas which are rendered as images as they appear about as large as the punctuation.Normal diagrams are also small and must be viewed with the zoom function.Apologies for rating the book based on formatting, but there's no other apparent way to contact the publisher.Once the issues are resolved I will fix the rating to fix the ""outlier"" it has created."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have already used machine algorithms in production with Spark and Python, but I wanted to have a better understanding of how the algorithms work and more importantly what the variations, strengths/weaknesses, and trade-offs are for each algorithm.  This book was exactly what I've been looking for.The authors explain the algorithms fluidly without any reference to specific programming libraries or languages.  They introduce the concepts very well before moving into the specifics of the logic and math behind the algorithms.  Following a thorough explanation of how the algorithm works, the authors then describe variants and pitfalls based on their prior foundation.So, if you aren't a math major but would like to understand the concepts and details of how ML works along with practical knowledge of variants, parameter tuning, and trade-offs, then this book should be exactly what you need.Finally, the algorithms covered are the most commonly used in ML.  AI isn't covered.  Look at the Table of Contents to see which algorithms are explained."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Supervised machine learning only. Basically a bunch of applications for an undergrad CS class. Light on theory. Very well structured though and excellent if you want to see some applications of machine learning in action. For deeper treatment see coursera courses by Geoff Hinton of Toronto and the Stanford ML class.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Machine Learning is brilliantly explained in this outstanding book. You will learn the subject a lot better than in many other books in the market. The only downside of this book is the lack of examples with programming code, especially in Python. I strongly urge the authors to do so in a next edition. A lot in the area is learned by doing, by using good software development practices."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Here is my opinion, none of the books out there on Machine Learning cover all the topics needed to understand basics, underlying fundamentals and also how to program using myriad frameworks out there. The trick is to find the sources(books) that complement each other in filling this need. Here is one book that explains underlying fundamentals of ML in a very simple and intuitive way for starters. This is not meant for someone that has advanced mathematical background and intuitions, but I believe they too would benefit from the clarity this book adds. Also it explains some of the topics that are not generally elaborated well and rushed in most books, for example entropy, ID3, distance metrics etc. This a good complimentary book to everything I have in my bookshelf about ML. The price point of this books definitely stings though."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great introductory book to this field.  I would highly recommend this for computer scientists or other engineers looking to get an understanding of this field.  I have read a number of books that are too heavy with theory and some that are a bit on the skimpy side and leave out details that are important for a true practical implementation.  This has just the right mix.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A solid written, practical book. But could use more advanced knowledge to increase its usefulness. This machine learning book functions more of a basic reference."

How am I supposed to download the free ebook now? I can't understand black and white diagrams at some places.Apart from all this. The quality is good overall. Packaging was also good. Content is obviously awesome.Just missing is the ebook. Huh..
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The printing quality of the book is very good. It's definitely not a counterfeit, although I haven't tried out the link for ebook I don't care about it cause you can get ebook online anyway if I want, but you buy the book to have it physically.Of course the content of the book needs no introduction, top notch.If you want it go for it."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Una buena forma de entrar a los conceptos y la ""programación"" de las técnicas de aprendizage automático!Buen libor d eintroducción sin tener que programar código."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was pretty excited pre-ordering this book - ML concepts explained for kids with pictures would be great! Similar to other ML books/courses but at the kids level.However this book is not that - it is to a large extent a printed collection of webpages with screenshots for author's website with Scratch3-based tutorials/templates for ML projects.It's a step-by-step instructions with screenshots on filling all the forms on the website and modifying the scratch3-templates to make them work.The most frustrating part is that the book contains _outdated_ instructions for website templates - the templates evolved and now when the book tells you to make a modification to a scratch code - there is no even such a code on the website, so you cannot use the book.It would be much better just to have the instructions for tutorials on the web-site and keep them up-to-date rather than sell the printed version of instructions as a book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I compared a lot books to introduce kids to machine learning and this is by far the best out there. It is amazing to have a ML/AI professional like Dale Lane taking the time to writing and building a free website to teach and inspire the new generations of kids about ML. Thanks Dale! Great and easy to follow exercises. It worth every penny.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,A somewhat advanced book. Useful if you want to know more than what your statistical program libraries deliver more or less automatically. Possible more for the evolving specialist than anyone for whom the topic is more of a hobby.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,great book
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Please ignore the other reviews saying you need minimal maths and that this book is an excellent read.It is a difficult read with very little flow. Definitions and equations are presented virtually on every page with no real link between them, or indeed the reason, background and real life application for them. Examples are trivial and not really requiring the formulae presented to solve, whereas the multitude of end of chapter questions (posed at degree level) do not get worked examples which could be used to solve them. The reader of this book alone, without previous work, has no chance whatsoever of answering these. Are answers to the questions available? If not Ibelieve the questions provide no added value.The book is however, a great door stop. It provides a valuable compendium of formulae and definitions. Not a lot else though."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am doing course related to machine learning and this book helps me with the study. I also have bishop but that book has too much math and I cannot follow. This one is explained in the simpler way. Less proof. Give you the intermediate detail on topics. Not for beginner or expert.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A very clear and concise book. I highly recommend this it.The Concepts are explained well with sufficient examples. One of the best books out there for machine learning.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is a fair consolidation of most bayesian machine learning algorithms, and one can gradually build up the necessary knowledge going through this book (not necessarily in the order of the book as written, nor in a single pass). It is however best used in conjunction with additional resources on the subject, i.e. online resources that deal with specific concepts from different angles than the book. The last comment applies also to the math/probability refresher chapters.One aspect somewhat lacking is a more systematic treatment of computational complexity, given that this and similar books are read by practitioners who need to code, modify or analyze code implementations."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is extremely well written. I have been reading it on my own, and the exercises are challenging without being so hard that I need a solution guide. The content is quite applicable to the math needed to understand modern approaches to Machine Learning."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"BRML is one of the best machine learning books I've read (others include Bishops PRML, Alpaydin's book, and Marsland's algorithmic ML book). In my view, it isn't the best one to start with and a combination of intro course lectures from Coursera or Udacity, basic tutorials online and some reading on Quora or StackExchange, and one of the books I mentioned before are probably best for the absolute beginner. Reason being, ML is ultimately a mathematical subject and this book isn't afraid to use it to explain things. That said, it isn't crazy advanced stuff, so if you're comfortable reading math then you will be OK.The book covers a very large amount of material, and at times it can be lacking in deeper explanations that may be more beneficial to the beginner. This is to be expected somewhat, but if you are looking for something more comprehensive in a particular area then you are more likely to be some type of professional and you should be skilled enough to know how to dig deeper (whether that is with other texts or papers online, and there are references to support this process in BRML at the ends of the chapters). It's not simple reading, but if you pay attention you should learn a lot.I haven't personally gone over the graphical models-related parts in detail, but I have gone through the introductory chapters and chapters on machine learning, neural networks, sampling methods, and a few others. This book delivered on the mathematical rigor just when I needed it most. If you are an ML algorithms researcher, this is a very good book to have around for reference. From the chapters that I have read, I was able to implement many machine learning algorithms from scratch. Eventually I'll get to the more complicated ones (I'm looking forward to attempting an HMM), but the simple ones so far have been easy after reading through Barber's explanations.The supplementary code available is OK, not the most organized and not too well-commented, but I'm absolutely thankful for its existence as it has helped to clarify things many times in ways that abstract mathematical symbols cannot. Being able to play with code that I didn't want to write myself is very helpful when I don't want to start from scratch myself. But I'm just nitpicking a little here, and most books don't come with code so really Barber is ahead of the curve on this one. There is also ample pseudocode, which is helpful when the code itself isn't too clear.Like some of the other reviewers I began reading this book from the PDF draft that David Barber has made available online, and that ultimately motivated me to buy a hard copy. I highly recommend this book, but if you have doubts just have a look for yourself!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unlike many (most?) books and courses on machine learning, Barber's outstanding text is very suitable for self study. There are many reasons for this, and high among them is the fact that he carefully explains, with commonsense examples and applications, many of the tougher logical, mathematical and processing foundations of pattern recognition.For relative beginners, Bayesian techniques began in the 1700s to model how a degree of belief should be modified to account for new evidence. The techniques and formulas were largely discounted and ignored until the modern era of computing, pattern recognition and AI, now machine learning. The formula answers how the probabilities of two events are related when represented inversely, and more broadly, gives a precise mathematical model for the inference process itself (under uncertainty), where deductive reasoning and logic becomes a subset (under certainty, or when values can resolve to 0/1 or true/false, yes/no etc. In ""odds"" terms (useful in many fields including optimal expected utility functions in decision theory), posterior odds = prior odds * the Bayes Factor.For context, I'm the lead scientist at IABOK dot org-- we design algorithms for huge data mining problems and applications. This text is our ""go to"" reference for programmers not up to speed in many of the new pattern recognition algorithms, including those writing new versions. All the most recent relevant models, from a probability standpoint, are represented here, with a clarity that is stunning. My only criticism (a mild one) is that, when applying Barber's examples to Bodies of Knowledge and data mining, he skips Prolog, backward chaining, predicate calculus and other techniques that are the foundation of automated inference systems (systems that extend knowledge bases automatically by checking whether new propositions can be inferred from the KB as consistent, relevant, etc.).In the next 20 years, algorithms will rule this planet. If you either want to see the future of your grandkids, or participate in it if you're young, this is a MUST HAVE exploration of where what we used to call AI is now headed. There IS plenty of calculus in this volume, so don't mistakenly think it is ""simple"" -- but if you put the time in, you can ""get it"" even if you're a bright undergrad level thinker. The author's goal of training new algorithm programmers is laudable and right on point for where pattern recognition is headed.With this amount of math, how can we star it high for self study? Easy: unlike most ""recipe"" books that just give bushels of codes or techniques, the authors here give the what, where when and why of both code and math, not just the how, as their goal is independent, creative contributors who can write their OWN algorithms. There are a few minor UK vs US differences in terminology also (event space instead of sample space, for example), but they expand the reader's horizon rather than distract or annoy as some others do. There are others like Bishop and many more that have more recipes, and more compact and difficult math, but you have to either be really good (just show me the recipe) or really bad (I don't know what I'm doing, but can follow this recipe) to benefit from them. This is a happy middle ground that does not disappoint."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a Big query practitioner, I found the book very fascinating. The concept are concise with interesting problem statement to work on. I feel, the book is designed in such a way that you will be getting your basics clear and then move on to the difficult part. BigQuery cost depends on size of data getting scanned and queries mentioned in the book gives you the best cost optimization. I would highly recommend to refer this book who are exploring BigQuery and ML related problem statement."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,It is very disappointing when the code does not work. How do they ever go to print if they have not checked their code to work?
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is full-color.It has a ""practical"" focus similar to many popular Python ML books, which makes it an excellent read. Many ML books can get extremely technical, not only mathematically, but also in code. For example, the authors of this book ""only"" cover a traditional log transformation and avoid overly complex/advanced concepts (e.g. Box-Cox or YeoJohnson transformation). This makes the book easier to read for beginners/intermediate readers, while not dumbing down the content, but rather ignoring more advanced techniques.The book gets my highest rating because of the several case studies from A - Z. Notably, the Logistic Regression (page 176) includes:- Removing outliers based on 1.5 x IQR.- Missing data imputation grouped by gender.- Replacing missing categorical data.- Dealing with class imbalance (SMOTE).- Dealing with multicollinearity.- Optimizing the cutoff for Logistic Regression (I've never seen this in sklearn).- ....Great ML book for R users.Franco"
,1.0 out of 5 stars,High cost but no good content. Some projects are given. No depth discussion. Dont buy it.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a unique book because it covers how to deploy Neural Networks to low-power microcontrollers using TensorFlow Lite. The idea here is to produce small smart devices that that consume only milliwatts of power, so can continuously run on small batteries or solar cells, for many months at a time. Applications could include “peel and stick” intelligent sensors for IoT applications. Until the emergence of lightweight machine learning frameworks such as Tensorflow Lite, this was not really a practical proposition, as you would need power hungry workstations to host the application. You will not get mind-blowing performance out of this approach, but it does open a vast array of potential applications for low-cost, in-field, smart devices.I read the book in a few days, but I have not tried any of the examples yet. If you have a little bit of programming experience, you should be able to pick up the concepts easily. There are four worked examples: A simple regression model to emulate a sine wave function, audio ‘wake word’ detection, an image classification model for person detection and a ‘magic wand’, which uses accelerometer data to detect one of a number of hand gestures. They are all quite interesting examples. The book shows you how to port them to one of three different development boards – the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, Sparkfun Edge and STM32F746G.Whilst this covers a few fundamental concepts, it is not a primer on Neural Networks. If you are serious, I would recommend reading it alongside “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow” by Aurelien Geron, and also “Deep Learning with Python” by Francois Chollet. There is a lot more to cover about model architecture, optimisation and tuning hyperparameters, etc. However, when coupled with some other background experience, this book should provide an entry point to building some killer embedded smart devices.I like it a lot."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Frei heraus gesagt, ich habe nicht erwartet, dass das Buch die Neuesten Infos enthält.Und eigentlich wurde es nur gekauft, weil es ein Buch ist, und man die Informationen nicht aus dem Internet zusammenstückeln muss. Lesefluss beim Lernen ist durchaus schön.Jedoch funktioniert kein einziger Link (kein-einziger-Link!), ganz so als ob das Hosting dafür komplett abgekündigt worden wäre, somit muss man sich den Code mit Google selbst zusammensuchen. Und das ist peinlich.Was weiterhin noch dazu gesagt werden muss ist, alles, was das Buch enthält, findet man bei Google im ersten Link, wenn man ""Tensorflow Lite"" googled. Das ist einerseits gut, weil man dann die Links nicht braucht, andererseits würde ich das Buch niemanden empfehlen, der kein Buch braucht, um zu lernen.Sinnvoller Anwendungszweck: Im Bett liegen und sich fortbilden. Dafür habe ich es gekauft, dafür brauche ich es.Trotzdem fühlt man sich betrogen, wenn man sich alle Links selbst zusammen suchen muss, immerhin ist das die Grundlage des Buches und man hat dafür verdammt noch eins gezahlt."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A thoroughly researched book, I can’t believe how much of how I live as a woman has been affected by men being seen as the default. Very insightful but also disheartening, so much damage to undo. Caroline cuts men too much slack suggesting they ‘just didn’t think’ of women, I believe in many cases they just didn’t care. This book should be a compulsory read for anyone who runs a business, makes products.. basically anything that should cater to both sexes!"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,I sent both 1 star reviews and don't know how to take them away.. The bookstore is taking very good care of the misunderstanding. They are to be plainly recommended.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When this book first arrived, I had a lot of buyer's remorse. I wanted something to read on the side, not as a textbook for a class I'm taking or anything like that. I wasn't expecting it to be this big. How could I possibly read all this?However, it's big for a reason. This book is filled with every possible thing you might want to know in the field of AI. It is all-encompassing from what I've seen. It also explains things very well in my opinion. Things are clear. You can clearly go through it, and although the math might need some note-taking, the book generally makes it easy for you to understand with examples. If you want to start delving into AI, machine learning, etc, but feel daunted about all the different crazy terms they use (adverserial networks, loss functions, overfitting, etc.), this is a good book to introduce to all this. It certainly did for me (Chapter 18: Machine Learning)"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is indeed one of the best books on Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is comprehensive in that in its 1,145 pages it covers and effectively explains concepts and practices; It is authorative as it is written and edited by some people who are pioneers in AI especially Peter Norvig; Being the 3rd edition it clearly updates and augments another 20% to the 80% of the 2nd edition with updates.With the massive number of reviewers and contributors, the book presents a balanced, realistic, and and down-to-earth understanding.The biggest attraction of this book, unlike many other books on this subject is that: 1. It avoids hype but humbling explaining things, and 2. It does not force you to understand things by referring you to some code fragment that is difficult to understand or execute.I liked the fact that this book has a nice and logical organization. Contents: I. Artificial Intelligence, II. Problem Solving, III Konwledge, Reasoning, and Planning, IV. Uncertain Knowlege and Reasoning, V. Learning, VI. Communicating, Presenting, and Acting, VII. Conclusion.Excellent work!"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best introductory review to Artificial Intelligence on the market.  It's very well written and organized.  There are other books that are better for focusing on one particular aspect of AI, but as a general book this is the best I've seen.  If you are looking for a really good introductory textbook to AI that does not completely dumb things down, buy this book.Most of the negative comments about this book come from people stating that it's not a big enough update from the prior edition.  While it's true that the entire field of AI has not been completely updated since the last edition, it's also not the case that this book comes out with new editions with the frequency of some Calculus or Economics textbooks where new editions seem to come out purely to ensure students can't buy a used book for the course.  The updates are substantial.  Whether the new edition gives you enough extra to want to buy it if you own the old edition is a decision only you can make for yourself after spending some time at the website for the book aima.cs.uberkeley.edu.The Kindle conversion of this book is absolutely horrendous.  I prefer to buy electronic copies of books if possible so I don't have to carry a heavy hard copy around since I often read while commuting.  I would not recommend that for this book, even though at a 1000+ textbook sized pages, it is a pretty substantial book.  Fortunately a friend of mine had bought a Kindle copy of the book and I was able to see how bad it was and I bought the hard copy.I recently got an email telling me Amazon was sending out an updated version of the Kindle version of Steve Job's biography because the conversion hadn't been done properly.  They really need to do that for this book.  Once done it may be a good idea to state on the website that the Kindle conversion has been fixed."

As the first reviewer said, it's an evolving subject so keep looking for new material.It's a well-edited hardcover book and at this price it's a steal."

The scikit learn section is a great reference, nice detailed explanation with good references for further reading to deepen your knowledge. The tensor flow part is weaker as examples become more complex. Chollet’s book Deep Learning with Python, which uses Keras is much stronger, as the examples are easier to understand as Keras is a simple layer over tensor flow to ease the use. Also Chollet explains the concepts better and nicely annotates his code.Buy this book for scikit learn and overall best practise for machine learning and data science.Buy Chollet’s Deep Learning using Python for practical deep learning itself.Overall still a practical book with Jupyter Notebook supplementary material."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing book. I would just like to point out that the description for the kindle edition carries the disclaimer (in bold) that ""Graphics in this book are printed in black and white"". This is not true, they are very much in colour and this makes a huge positive difference, especially for graphical information presented in multiple dimensions.As an enthusiastic hobbyist, some of the descriptions of what is ""under the hood"" were slightly beyond my ability to fully comprehend. However, the book is so well-written that this becomes inspiring rather than frustrating. So my next project is to improve my math."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought and read the book after reading glowing reviews. Over all, I think it gives a great overview of the field. The main problem that I saw was an inconsistent style of writing with some passages presented in a way that it is easy to understand to all, where as others are hard to crack. At times the author also goes into professional diatribe against other researchers in the same field which, IMO, should be avoided in a general book on the subject.This definitely is not a book for those who doesn't have atleast college level maths knowledge, especially statistics."

This leaves us with way forward for research3) The author makes you revisit the preconceptions of too many ML enthusiasts today. ie that of thinking ML = DLNegatives:1) The book criticizes many masters of their respective fields without sufficient evidence. especially in the preface.2) The book has genetic algorithms as one of it's master algorithms. But researchers have clearly shown that genetic algorithms are inferior to hill climbing. The author has admitted as much in the text.The valid reason for a central place for evolution is the existence of us. But perhaps the essense of evolution has probably not been captured fully by the form of genetic algorithms in prevalance.3) The book contains errors on some technical points.

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I know that this book is a bible of RL. However, the print quality is extremely low. For example, all figures in color are blurry and faint as if the book was printed with low toners/inks. I've already tried ""replace order"" to fix the book's bad hardcover quality, but looks like that wasn't the only problem. Unfortunately, now I only have a single option to return with a $0.00 value because this book is a replacement of my original order. Curious whether it's a problem of MIT Press or someone else..."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read the entire book cover to cover, doing every (non-programming) exercise, as part of a PhD involving RL. I was also familiar with the first edition (1998).The 2nd edition (2018) has been entirely reworked; it is much longer, the structure has changed, the notation has changed, many new topics are discussed. Same as the first edition, the second edition is both a reference book and a pedagogic manual. The main differences are:(1) Part I, which deals with the fundamentals of RL in a simplified setting, is carefully worded in order to convey understanding in the same accessible, intuitive manner as in the first edition, but also paying closer attention to mathematical rigor and systematicity.(2) Part II, which deals with RL with function approximation, is at times somewhat involved mathematically compared to the first edition, reflecting the general evolution of the field of Machine Learning. The most difficult sections are clearly marked as such, and can be skipped. But taking on the difficulties straight on is always (positively) rewarding, in the end.(3) Part III deals with related developments in psychology and neuroscience, which are a welcome addition to a field that has branched across disciplines. This should be useful to neuroscientists and computational neuroscientists, as well as to experimental/cognitive psychologists.Many exercises are included. I am no math buff and found that I could do every single one of them on my own, which is unfortunately not usually the case in other A.I. books. These exercises serve to help the reader understand key issues by working them out for themselves, in a guided manner; they make self-study possible and enjoyable.This is an indispensable book for anybody working in RL. My only issue is that I'm too late to be referenced in it, but I haven't lost hope of making it in the 3rd edition, which is expected in 2038."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the book. It explains things adequately. The representations take a little bit to digest. I think that the field is more difficult than it needs to be. This is mostly because math is one of the most convoluted areas in education. IF we scrapped all of that crap about the names, and worked with names that had logical connections, then the learning would be greatly enhanced. As it is, when you want to learn the fundamentals of math, you are required to learn math history. We teach about some people as if they are extraordinary - as if no one else is working on the same things. But the first person to cross the finish line shall be immortalized like a god. This book is full of those references, but that is at least what I was looking for. Since that is how the world works, it makes some of the communications easier if we understand this convolution. I mean, a Kalman filter is really only a control system feedback loop of a Bayes equation. If you don't know about those people, then this book is either ripe for the reading, or a little bit out of reach. I am by no means claiming talent at taking these abstract ideas and presenting them in an easily consumable fashion. I would say that a class on Abstract ABC's so to speak would allow us to speak in a more abstract fashion and approach math form its constituent parts when building an algorithm. If anything, the symbolic crafting in this book (and the changes detailing how the symbolic representations have changed) is priceless. It details how refactoring can make things more understandable. Unfortunately, it is only done as a means of representing the author's work (which is the intent). I long for the author that is willing to rewrite the formulas, perhaps using artificial intelligence to compile optimal absorption. Until then, anyone learning more about math history than math will never be a leader in math. At some point, there are enough names to overload a lifetime of learning. This necessitates a simpler approach equivalent to the building blocks of atoms. Then, you learn how the relationship of the pieces affects the whole. I understand that mathematicians who are publishing new materials must arrive there, I just don't think that the process of getting there needs to be so difficult. Keep math history as a class called math history. Let math be just that - math.I included the rant as a reason why I liked this book. Revising the notation leaves me with hope that we will develop better means of conveying the pieces comprising the models that allow us to expand our imaginations on what is possible. It could be written with much more clarity and readability, but I think that will have to wait until we develop better semantics of mathematical expression. Cheers to all, comments welcome!"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update 2/29/2020: I thank Reza Borhani who responded to my original review pointing out formatting problems with equations and graphs in the Kindle edition. The digital version of the eBook was subsequently replaced with a much more usable version (essentially PDF-like) and I revised my review as a result. I do still hope the publisher eventually releases a true Kindle edition as these provide more flexibility in sizing fonts and light & dark mode support.  This minor point aside, my original review still stands: This is one of the best ML books available and is well worth the investment.This is one of the best books on ML today; the 1-star rating is only for the poor formatting of the Kindle edition, not the book's contents.  The Kindle edition's equations and graphs are small to the point of illegibility. I have both the print and Kindle editions. I use the Kindle (iPad & PC) edition when I commute or travel. The iPad Kindle edition graphs are usable, but many equations are too small to see. The PC Kindle edition has very poor sizing of both equations and graphs - to the point that you need a screen magnifier to see any details. I purposely gave this book a 1-star rating in the hope that they'd update the Kindle editions to make the equations and graphs usable. I will revise the rating to 5-stars if they do. Until then, you may want to stick with the print edition only. The content imparts an intuitive, but deep understanding of the subject and is well worth it."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is fantastic:  It blends theory and practical-implementation seamlessly.  There are pure theory ML books, and very practical ML books (such as those from Packt publications), but very difficult to find a book which mixes the two rigorously.The theoretical part  is not abstruse lemma-proof-type, but rather a solid three Chapters on Optimization (with more detailed math left to the Appendix)--more like an Engineering math book; you can derive the equations yourself.  The chapters are replete with PYTHON code to help you open up your IDE and crank through.  The diagrams/graphics are superlative, very intuitive, and brings home the underlying notions.What is an absolute gem are the chapters on Feature Learning, Selections and Engineering: Chapters 9, 10 and 11; for that alone, one should purchase this book.  Self-consistent, neat and covers nonlinear as well.The exercises follow the book closely, and in many of them, one has to redo or scenario analyse the material in the body of the chapter, reinforcing your knowledge.Solid book, highly recommended."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent book for machine learning. If you have basic knowledge in python then this book is going to help you a lot...short crisp and simple explanation.. just go for it
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The book covers most of the relevant topic. Its organization is also good. However, the way it is written makes it hard to learn much from it. Concepts aren’t explained well. Code is messy and unclear. Feels like the editors were on holiday or wanted it to be quickly published. The only way I could use it, is to read about some topic there then do my own research elsewhere."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is excellent in my opinion, but the cover came with some stamps (white where it is written 'new' and a small one black on the top of the cover)."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,The writing style is a bit unfriendly. There is lack of consistency of lanuage/symbolism.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have read a similar book on Machine Learning, namely Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (by Bishop). Before I read Barber's book, I considered Bishop's book to be the best in the Machine Learning (with bayesian focus). However, after reading this book, I can definitely say that it is better that Bishop's book in many sense. There are lots of examples in each chapter with matlab codes for many of them. Also, it covers more material that Bishop. Chapters on dynamic models and graphical models are particularly awesome. This book doesn't assume much background in probability (one master's level course on probability and statistics is probably more than enough). However, some chapters are advanced, and are mentioned so in the book."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This rating is not about the book, but the print that got shipped to me (seller:City_Sales). To be clear, I love the book and in fact when the print version was released, I had personally thanked Dr Barber over mail (I had been consulting his freely available online copy).Now coming to the print. I bought the paperback and this print is bad. I would have been fine with it if the seller had described what I'm getting. It would have been up to me to consider the price-quality trade-off. But not mentioning that in the description is disingenuous. I'm not sure who is to blame - the seller or the publisher. The seller is definitely to blame for selling this copy on Amazon - see pics.Here's the problem: most of the book is printed in black and white. Even the pages that are supposed to have colored images on them. However, there are clumps of successive pages, with just the colored images from these pages inserted within the binding.  It's quite clear that all of the book was printed in black and white, and then the relatively expensive colored printing was done by grouping together images from across the chapters. Sometimes you'd see a colored image from a chapter that is appears after the image!Look at the attached pics.1st pic: chapter appears after image. The image is tagged as ""24.3"", but see the equation number that appears quite a few pages later: ""17.1.4"".2nd pic: Image 17.15 appears as in black and white in the chapter, but appears later again in the clump of the color-printed pages.3rd pic: some images do not have a colored version. In the first frame, you have image 24.10 in the chapter, in the 2nd frame you can see that we gave image 24.10 a miss in the colored set of pages. The third frame shows what the image actually looks like in the book.4th pic: Is this even legal? There was a black strip covering some print at the back. I removed it by applying some water and this is what I saw."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good introduction to Bayesian reasoning. This book will be a good reference for anyone involved in use of Bayesian models.
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm so excited for this book. Unfortunately, the font on the paperback is hard to read and I haven't made it very far. The font is smaller than I expected. I don't usually have to wear glasses for books. Also, the bar in the lowercase ""e"" is light and seems (to me at least) like parts of the letters are missing. I've included a picture comparing it with Hadley's Advanced R book. I wish I could swap this out for the Kindle version."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty mediocre book, doesn’t go into very much detail in any of the chapters, tries to cover everything so does a generally weak job.  This might be suitable for a non-data practitioner who wants to have an idea of what tools their data practitioners use. But don’t expect to learn how to actually use any of these tools.As a textbook for a class I’m taking, the formatting is poor, with example boxes split across multiple pages unnecessarily, and text that is hard to understand. In particular, the chapter comparing R and Python begins with a comparison of both languages, masking them seem very similar in nature, when in reality they’re pretty different. And when I went to the second half of this chapter to learn about R, it was a superficial treatment that didn’t highlight the most important packages to learn, and then the IDE Coverage was of a tool that at the time of writing did not even support R.  No coverage of R studio, etc.If you know python and the pandas library, you will see that if you followed the example in the excerpt photo in this review, people would question your training.  You can do it this way, but there are pythonic conventions.  This is not how you typically import pandas or define a pandas dataframe. Just use conventions, please.There are enough decent books on data analytics tools and languages that this book just should not have been published in its current state."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a few years' experience with Arduino, ESP32 and STM32 microcontrollers, but was seriously challenged to find my way around TinyML using publicly available resources. The combination of Google Colab and hands on exercises in the book provided the basic knowledge to get a head start with the technology. Note that the hardware requirements are quite specific: a regular Arduino Nano doesn't have the same features as a Nano 33 BLE Sense and will require significantly more effort to get the exercises working."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Book looks good but was published before the tensorflow lite for microcontrollers is anywhere near ripe. The links in the book don't work, you need to go to another GitHub repo and the code is sometime vastly different from the book, with no explanation. This feels more like a paint by number project book because it tackles advanced C++ macros, hard debugging and more while at the same time explaining what is a pointer.I would not recommend unless you already have good knowledge of microcontrollers, C++, Python and machine learning. You are better of checking on youtube and keep the money for books about stable subject that wont change after 6 months."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is out of date, some conceptions just skipped"
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this book on a recommendation of a friend who has written a book on home automation and regularly give talks on home automation.I found this book worthless for building a low power edge device to detect a wake word and move the audio to a higher functioning speech recognition platform. After reading the first few chapters and skimming some others, the best that I could accomplish, from this book, is building a stand alone project that lights an LED based on saying yes or no.There is no information about getting any data off any of the platforms to another device. No information about MQTT, one of the common protocols for home automation.Looking at the comments section on the website for one of the boards described in the book I found that everyone had nothing good to say about the ""Edge"" board. One comment said ""how to keep an idiot occupied for an hour."" No one really got the platform working to their satisfaction.One comment referred to a different web site and I looked up the nano BLE sense. No info on any of the websites for this board about tinyML or MQTT.  MQTT is not supported over bluetooth to best of my knowledge.I don't want to build code from scratch without an example. So right now I am at a loss to determine what I would do with the book or any board described in the book.  It has been put on my bookshelf and I haven't looked at in months.Based on discussions with my friend, I am building a home automation system using raspberry PIs and open source code."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am using the TinyML book to develop usable, hands-on competence with Tensorflow and  machine learning. The book is a great starting point for learning this technology. You don't need a supercomputer,  you can run the programs in this book from your PC connected to very low cost devices from Arduino, SparkFun and other vendors.  You don't have to be working in the tiny ML space ( < 1mW, small memory, etc. ) to benefit from this book as the concepts are applicable to whatever the opposite of TinyML is. The contagious enthusiasm of the authors is very impressive. Look for them on youtube,  they know this material very well and are very generous with help and support.  The book is biased toward how to get things done, and is light on deep theory."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a fantastic, well-written, highly-entertaining resource for devs of all levels curious about running machine learning models on resource-limited devices and looking to play with edge computing. It goes beyond Google's online documentation and gives practical demos and explanations that make sense.Basically, you can follow along the book by running pre-built notebooks in Google Colab to train ML models, then compiling the code to binaries, which you then flashing to the microcontroller - Arduino, SparkFun Edge, and Stm32f7 Discovery Kit are supported with great instructions for all three platforms.For future versions of the book, I'd like to see:- instructions for those working in Windows. All the makefiles and build scripts are MacOS/Linux, but providing a facility for those working in Windows environments would be nice, too (Windows Subsystem for Linux, Visual Studio's nmake, cygwin, cloud environment, virtual machine, etc.).- notebook locations on Github and Google Colab have moved out of 'experimental' status and so the URLs have changed, so some poking around is required to find the code (not hard - the dedicated notebook for the ""Hello, world!: example now lives in the /train directory in the repos).- the book doesn't mention having a serial breakout programmer, just the microcontroller and a USB cable. I had to order the serial adapter separately.Overall, the book is really well laid out with a friendly voice and demos that are truly fun to work through. The approach to running the examples, then explaining the concepts for running ML on embedded environments and underlying C++ constructs is a great way to present the material. I prefer this than the traditional 6 chapters of iterative building and only at the end you arrive at the finished product. This gives you something to play with right away."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really looking forward to this book for intelligent robotics projects at home, I was especially excited about the potential of using Tensorflow in an embedded fashion easily since my past workarounds have involved hooking up an Arduino to a Raspberry Pi that would run Tensorflow.While I did enjoy reading through the projects I didn't enjoy implementing them primarily due to a large amount of boilerplate that I had to setup before I could get started. Perhaps this will change in subsequent releases but for now I'd recommend going through Arduino tutorials or Unity ML agents tutorials to play around with robotics at home."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Apparently this textbook delivery was sidelined somehow in Maryland and arrived a day late. At least we didn't have to reorder as we did with another purchase that disappeared back in August. The box had clearly suffered a little collision or crushing from something, and the book ended up with a few bent edges, but was otherwise fine. This is not a commentary on the contents of the book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is just an additional note to the top review, as the time I am writing this review ,Dec 2018, the book I purchased does contain the last two chapters but I can’t say whether this apply to all or just my case. Other from that, the printing quality is decent, and I have yet to find any missing pages. In general, the rich and quality content of the book combining with that low price, I think this is an amazing choice."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a CS major and have been interested in AI since early on in my university time, but my budget was small, so I bought some of the more inexpensive AI books out there. Most of them were disappointing--the language was stilted, the explanations were very formal and required long explanatory chapters on Turing machines to be understandable, and worst of all, they were outdated--some of them were written years before Deep Blue. I purchased this book for a university class on AI and loved it from the minute I opened it. It's very readable, includes both formal and informal explanations of most topics, and is about as up to date as a textbook like this can be. It feels as though it were written for modern readers like me, who prefer to get an intuitive grasp on something before diving in to the formal development. Like all textbooks, it's expensive, but worth it if you're interested in AI. I plan to keep it after my class is over."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is completely different from the version that is, most likely, the version any US colleges are going to use. Top left corner says ""circulation of this edition outside the Indian subcontinent is UNAUTHORIZED"" and it's only $20. Not sure why this is the book that shows up as the first option rather than the one that should have. Double check the cover with your teacher. There's no color in this version, which means it's not the real copy. I'd just go get the real version instead if you want to follow along properly."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too big of a book and too much information. Hard to follow along unless you’re really into reading.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Full disclosure, I have not read this rather large book cover to cover. The parts I have read are quite clear and well written. Even having worked in related areas for years, I learned interesting stuff from ever chapter.The reason I am giving my review 4 stars is that some of the material is a bit dated, given the fast pace of advancement in AI. Given that updating a book like this is a monumental task, I hope the authors will produce an update soon."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read review before ordering this, but decided to take a risk.  My book came in 10 days earlier which is super surprise!  And many reviews mentioned that there's so many blank pages, print quality is very poor and hard to read.  Well, my copy came in with perfect condition! It was wrapped with vinyl cover like a brand new and this is a brand new book.  I skim thru the pages and didn't find any issues."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This review is organized into two parts. The first part gives a general overview of the textbook and my thoughts about the content, while the second part gives a summary of the problems I've encountered while reading the Kindle version.This book was made by multiple authors. Fortunately, the book's definitions and summaries are generally coherent. It has a through coverage on the history of AI, the definitions (those that are controversial have been noted as such), and provides psuedocode of many algorithms. Similar to other textbooks on this topic, it does not provide run-throughs of those algorithms.The organizations of the book can be improved. I have some problems with the way they organized the material on the second part of the book (II: Problem Solving). Chapter 3 is named ""Solving Problems by Searching"", but I didn't realize all they did was on classical searches in Chapter 3 until I read Chapter 4. They could have explained why uniform-cost search is uninformed search even though it has a cost function better than they did in the textbook. A better naming scheme for those chapters would be ""Ch3: Global Search "", ""Ch4: Local Search/... (I would suggest breaking Chapter 4 and put it into different places.)"".I bought the Kindle version, and it had many formatting problems. Most of them are minor (such as missing a ""space"" between two words, images appearing in different locations, image sizes too small, etc.) However, I had caught one specific error in the second part of the book (somewhere between chapter 3-5) where the fact is exactly the opposite than the one written (forgot to add the negation?) I should have marked and noted it so I can write down which error it was in the review but I was too lazy...But it's a good purchase overall!"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book was quite excellent, especially in presenting concepts to people who had no previous knowledge or experience with artificial intelligence. It provides an excellent overview of artificial intelligence concepts, though they gloss over the statistical parts of it (I guess they assumed you should already have knowledge of these).The reason why this book got 4 instead of 5 stars was for two reasons: (1) the statistical knowledge that one needed to know in order to understand a concept was not adequately covered in the book; and (2) it is pretty much impossible to skip around the book (you're forced to learn chapter by chapter, otherwise you'll get lost in the later ones, so in terms of learning methods, it's not really flexible).If you want to learn about artificial neural networks and reinforcement learning, the Mitchell text is pretty decent as well. Wikipedia also helps."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I'm in a class that requires this text book. So far I have to say they provide good examples and explain he complex parts pretty well. They also add some humor in hear on example which I love. This book is a easy read compared to most text, and the HW question inside the book are fun to answer. This book makes me feel like I'm learning a lot.Ill update this again once the class is over and I'm farther in the book."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought the first version of this book . and now also the second. The new version is very comprehensive. If you are using Python - its almost a reference. I also like the emphasis on Neural networks (and tensorflow) - which (in my view) is where the Python community is heading. I am also planning to use this book in my teaching @Oxford Uni. The data pre-processing are also good. I found the sequence flow slightly unusual - but for an expert level audience .. its not a major issue
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is excellent for the following demographic:People who already have a decent level of skill and experience in statistics who want to: - 1) Elevate their understanding of ML techniques without absolutely breaking their skull on dense theory - 2) Learn how to implement the algorithms in Python and gain moderate proficiency in sci-kit learnI would say it's not a beginner's book, but more for intermediates. I am half-way through and find it a little challenging, but definitely attainable. This balance I consider to be putting me right in the sweet spot for learning. To  judge whether you're a good candidate for this book, you can compare your experience and skill to me :I started this book after earning a PhD in the social sciences, which basically gave me good coverage in inferential and applied statistics (T, F distributions, p-values, confidence intervals, linear regression, one-way and factorial ANOVA, PCA, etc.). I also took a machine learning graduate course at my university and a few online courses in introductory ML for R. All of this background gave me solid grounding in statistics. With all this I still find this book somewhat challenging, but definitely not too hard. I'd say without my background I would find this book hard to get through. There is linear algebra, concepts like minimizing cost functions, bias/variance tradeoff, learning from errors, etc. So, if you are just starting out or reading the previous sentence and don't know what I'm talking about, I would recommend learning more stats fundamentals before starting this.After you gain some proficiency in stats, come learn this book and elevate your understanding of the algorithms, add nuance to them, integrate them into your mental conceptual structures more fully (e.g. you'll know more nuances of ML, e.g. which subsets of algorithms are preferred for controlling more of the bias, variance, how random forest is basically bagging with a twist, how adaboost's treatment of classification errors has kind of an element of perceptron implementation, and many more)."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book will stay on your reference shelf for years to come!The authors clearly have taught these materials many times before, and their significant mathematical and technical prowess is delivered using a very approachable style.  This book seems best suited for someone who wants to sit down and begin to apply Python Machine Learning to a problem that they already know they have.  It's not particularly an ""intro course to M.L."", but it contains enough details that you could easily follow along and learn how to use the various tools and techniques of the field if you've never seen or heard of them before.The copious notes scattered throughout this book are pure gold, mined from the obvious experiences of the authors while working in the field.  If there ever is a Machine Learning equivalent to the venerable ""Forrest M. Mims Engineering Notebook"" for electronics, I feel these two authors could write it!Once you use this book to work on your current M.L. problem in Python, you will find yourself returning to it as a reference for other problems in the M.L. space.  Its lucid explanations will help reinforce the topics presented, and cement your understanding of the materials.This book will get you writing Python Machine Learning code to work your current M.L. problem in no time flat!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"(I own the 1st edition, and was given early access to a pre-release PDF of the 2nd ed. My paperback copy just arrived.)This is the best book I've seen for professional software engineers to bootstrap themselves into Data Science, Machine Learning and (with the 2nd ed) Deep Learning. It makes heavy use of the scikit-learn library; and the latter chapters give an excellent high-level overview of TensorFlow. Books in this space can often feel either too basic or too academic. Not this one -- for me it hits the sweet spot of explaining and doing.What I love about Raschka's writing is how he builds up from theory to practical code. It lays out the concepts, math, and code together which helps comprehension. So, if you happen to be rusty in math, like me, you can look to the code to help explain what the equations actually do. The chapters of the book build up from each other; so many of the examples feel like they can be used as recipes for building your own custom models."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like:  The core chapters are a good introduction to five machine learning approaches and from that the structural elements of learning.  The author's description of how he and team abstracted and combined these elements into a synthesized algorithm, Alchemy, is told in a lively, convincing and interesting way.Dislike:  First, it's not clear who the target audience is.  The 'handwaving' opening and closing chapters seem aimed at the non expert.  However, the core chapters demand a basic appreciation of Markov, Bayes and probability, which the average reader won't have.  Second the language is idiosyncratic - particularly where the author refers to 'learning a model', by which he means 'training' or 'teaching' it logic and structure.  While I recognize the lack of a good word for this, 'learning' doesn't seem right at all.  I wondered if this was caused by translation from Portugese, but either way I think its the fault of Basic Books not doing their job as editors.  The lack of good editing is a serious detraction and makes key sections far too difficult to read.  This is noted by other reviewers who take a harsher line, but on the whole this detraction didn't diminish my overall rating."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The book describes the actual state of Machine Learning, explaining the main 5 styles in the field, and a little history about them.It isn’t a technical textbook, so it doesn’t go into deep detail, but it can get a little too abstract, or sometimes some mathematical terms are explained in such a superficial way, that if you didn’t know them, you won’t understand his explanations, e.g. Markov Chains, Bayes Theorem, etc.However, you get a general idea of the main differences between the five styles in machine learning, and the ways their algorithms try to find solutions to different problems. You won’t be able to program a neural network after reading the book, though!The main point of the book is, like the title says, to find a Master Algorithm, since in his opinion, those 5 styles of Machine Learning are not enough to solve all the problems. They have a field where they shine, but they are not general solution finders. He proposes to combine the 5 styles to create one final style that will solve any problem. I was a little disappointed he didn’t propose a total new paradigm, but instead he proposes to combine and patch different parts of the other 5 styles, like a Frankenstein monster that will do the job."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The structure of the book is good but the content insufficiently covers the material and presents little more than a shallow introduction.For example, how can one discuss time series forecasting of power loads without discussing weekends, holidays, anomalies, etc. Simply fitting hello world examples from the statstools library and slapping on a 40$ price tag is not enough.An overpriced title in my opinion, but good if you're looking for an introduction to time series forecasting and immediate deployment strategies to Azure."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this book to help me with my final projects for a data science bootcamp because the curriculum didn’t go deep enough into time series for me. Sadly, it was money - and time- wasted.I have three main issues:- A significant part of the short text is spent telling me what you’re going to tell me or going off on tangents about other ML algorithms that are not related to time series.- The audience is unclear. Terms such as feature vector, tensor and hyperparameter are assumed to be understood (which feels appropriate), but then they are followed up by a definition of median. I found myself alternating between skipping several pages of material and looking up critical missing information (see gripe 3).- Critical information is missing. The four components of stationarity are mentioned, but the text never addresses how to correct for these. When a SARIMAX model is introduced, the values for order and seasonal order are just thrown in with no discussion of how to determine these. If I hadn’t already had exposure to that, I would have been clueless where they came from. I was hoping to learn how & when to incorporate exogenous variables, but that was never discussed in any depth. Overall, the “why” was missing, which is way more important than the actual statmodels code snippets.I have a few pages bookmarked and a few entries highlighted, but overall, I’m back to StackOverflow and Machine Learning Mastery for help."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The book has very good concepts about time analysis, but It doesn't have many real case examples, it just relies on measuring temperature, it doesn't explain how to interpret graph,  Finally, some sample codes were misspelled in the book and it was hard to interpret so it became super difficult for me to use azure services correctly."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm new to using machine learning for forecasting, but I used machine learning in other areas throughout my recent career. I think this book is an ideal introduction to forecasting: all the examples are clear and meaningful (actionable in real life). I highly recommend it (even if you don't know Python; this book can actually be used as an introduction to the language as well). It was a great Christmas 2020 read! : )"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not read for entry level machine learning practitioner. I have been working and reading about Artificial Intelligence for more than 5 years and I'm just ready to understand what the author has mentioned there. So it can feel quite frustrating to reader who believed this is book without math, but it's book with logic and connections among many machine learning algorithm and practices.I enjoyed author's jokes and small little stories it does enrich and fresh discussion about not always super cool topics (yes I speak about Bayesian). Overall I will recommend it to advance AI practitioners who want to design and share next episode of AI understanding world.I will copy one of great thought from this book.""People worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they are too stupid and they have already taken over the world.""This is solely my impression, because author sometimes goes into great details. Nevertheless,amazing summary about current stage of AI."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pedro Domingos has to be given huge credit for being the first person to attempt a 'popular science' type book on the subject of machine learning.  This is by no means an easy task; there is a lot of material to cover in this area and some of it is complex. That said, I think this book could have been a lot better. I did actually like the author's writing generally, but I felt the book was poorly structured, the technical explanations in particular were poor, and after the final chapters I was left wondering if the entire book was less “impartial” than the prologue and early chapters might have lead me to believe.Whilst I think there's stuff in the book that could be improved, it's hard for an author to make those kind of improvements without feedback. I can't help but think that the input of editors/agents/publishers should have made this a much better read. It seems to me that this book was crying out for a ghost-writer/co-author experienced in 'popular science' writing. More importantly, I think it desperately needed proof reading by people unfamiliar with machine learning. My guess is that drafts of this book were read primarily by people highly experienced in this subject, i.e. people who already understood the material being presented. I'm really struggling to see how someone at Basic Books could have read the book prior to publication and thought, “Yep, that was relatively easy to follow”.The prologue claims the book is intended for a wide range of readers, pretty much from novice to expert. Personally, I would suggest that the only people who won't struggle with this book are experienced industry based practitioners and academics/researchers/post-docs in this area (and I guess also, readers who are happy to just skim sections they don't understand). To give some perspective, I have a grasp of ML basics, I currently work in a ML group (although my research is not explicitly ML), I've taken introductory and advanced masters units in the subject and have implemented some of the algorithms myself: Yet I struggled to understand much of this book – both the specific details and the broader overview.I may reread some of this book in a couple of years when I have a bit more understanding and experience under my belt. Perhaps then I will appreciate the details and the author's perspective better. At my current level of experience, I found the book very hard going, a frustrating read and I don't feel like I learnt very much from it. For the time being, I will stick to machine learning text books.Specific comments in no particular order (mostly negative - sorry):- Key fundamentals of the subject are either, not explained (e.g. 'hypothesis' as an ML term), poorly explained (e.g genetic algorithms are explained devoid of any mention of 'selection'), or left till way too late in the book (e.g. supervised v unsupervised learning left till p203).  ---This latter example is a real shame in my opinion, as I found this to be one of the best written chapters of the book.- Many other areas did not get the foundational explanations needed prior to developing ideas further.  Example: “The  most important question in any analogical learner is how to measure similarity.”  This crucial question is raised, then frustratingly left unaddressed because the subsequent text lacks any specific coverage of how this may be actually achieved.- I felt that 'hypothesis', 'feature'/'attribute', 'label', 'example' should have been explicitly defined, in the context of what they mean for ML, right at the start of the book. This would have given the reader a much firmer footing before seeing further explanations using these terms routinely.  Non ML readers will not appreciate, for example, the very specific use of 'hypothesis' wrt discussing ML algorithms.- The first few pages of the prologue has been described by another reviewer as (IIRC) evangelistic nonsense – It's a harsh comment but it's pretty much on the nail. The author is right to highlight the role ML already plays in our world, but he's overstating the case (for most people) almost to the point of ridiculousness. Most people's lives aren't like this (even in computer science). It's not an inspiring start to the book.- In the first 3 chapters 'very little' happens. I think this needs some significant condensing (or better, replacing with a chapter that covers fundamentals, gives some sense of supervised vs. unsupervised learning, and talks about how to measure similarity). As it is I had to wait to page 93 before we got started on ML proper.- The book is crying out for some diagrams. Of the few that are used, some could have easily been better. The important diagram illustrating the “five tribes” is neither intuitive nor informative. And why, when illustrating SVMs, would you not show the margin in the diagram? – Thus immediately giving an intuitive idea of the role of the support vectors and also differentiating SVM from the simpler classifier diagram.- There are places in the book where, if you're anything like me you'll be tearing your hair out for want of an explanation. In describing how nearest neighbour works, simply (and only) saying that: “It consists of doing exactly nothing” -  is incredibly unhelpful, especially when the next few pages go into the algorithm in more detail, in the absence of a foundational explanation of how it works.- Whilst in general, I liked the writing style, at times I found phrases and expressions used by the author to be pointlessly obscure – thus confusing the reader further, rather than clarifying. Two examples:  i) the heading “One if by land, two if by Internet” is probably baffling to the majority of people (who won't be aware of the original American War of Independence phrase it's derived from---and especially so for readers outside of the US) and so it doesn't help bring focus, or coherence or clarity to the subsequent text that it introduces.  ii) “As Isaiah Berlin memorably noted, some thinkers are foxes---they know many small things---and some are hedgehogs---they know one big thing”.  Metaphors are a great way of using an analogy to re-frame a difficult idea in familiar terms. They can thus render something complex or intractable as immediately intuitive. This doesn't work if the chosen metaphor is as unfamiliar or obscure as the concept it is supposed to explain!- “S curve” ...this term used throughout the whole book. In a book at this level, what's wrong with just calling it a sigmoid?- “We routinely learn MLNs...” ---It's a trivial point and I imagine I'll be accused of being a grammar pedant, but this occurs more than once in the book and I am sure other people will cringe at it. The correct word, if you don't want to use “teach”, is surely “train” ( or alternatively rearrange  along the lines of “we let the algorithms learn” or “the algorithms learned”).- Chapter 9.  i) I wasn't particularly enthralled by the storytelling/fable approach the author used here. That's just my personal view---others may like it.  ii) What particularly bothered me here was that suddenly it seemed that the book was no longer a general introduction/overview of machine learning and more a way to promote the author's own area of research. There is nothing wrong with an author presenting a partisan perspective, but I would have liked to have had a better sense that this was what was happening from the start, as the book till then had seemed like a (relatively) impartial broad coverage of the field (more experienced readers may have a different take on this).  iii) The failure to convey an intuitive sense or simple understanding of the various algorithms in earlier chapters of the book meant that when they all were all bundled together in one chapter, I became totally lost.  For me this chapter was a total train wreck.- Chapter 10 presents an interesting but somewhat rose-tinted view of an ML future. The author is clearly much better informed than I, in this area, but I still think that this could have been a little bit more 'balanced'.  I enjoyed the ideas, but the whole chapter neatly sidesteps the important “elephant in the room”--- that advanced MLs are inevitably likely to end up in the hands of the 'most powerful' (at least initially) – rather than the 'most benevolent' or 'philanthropic'. I also felt that there were a few occasions in this chapter where he was presenting his personal opinion as fact-–a personal bugbear of mine.  Examples i)…. technology develops as an 'S-curve' (aaargh) rather than exponentially,  ii) ...that we are at the end of Moore's law (again).- I particularly liked the adapted quotes presented in this chapter and the subsequent epilogue: “any sufficiently advanced AI is indistinguishable from god” and “the unexamined future is not worth inventing” ... nice touches (but only in those cases where it doesn't confuse, if the reader doesn't 'get' the reference!)- The book has a good reading list at the back (albeit with a few surprising absences), however, frustratingly the book does not cite sources in the main text for when specific topics (scientific work) are being discussed.- The index is excellent."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm struggling to see how so many people think this is an excellent introductory book to Machine Learning or a ""popular science"" book. I found it to be really quite technical and often very dry, and didn't do a particularly good job of familiarising the reader with complex jargon or concepts as it seemed to assume that the reader has a decent grounding in some technical concepts (or will pick them up very quickly!).Someone who already has a basic grasp of some of these concepts and wishes to read a book that gives a broad overview of the field ought to get a lot from it. But as a popular science book that a lay person can pick up, understand and enjoy? I doubt it."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great book covering many concepts that one should learn. This book gives R and Python syntaxes side by side for the analytics. Before going for this book it is highly recommended to learn basics of R or Python as this book is not going to cover the basics. The book explains the principle of statistics and directly jumps to the execution in R and Python. The book does not explain those concepts like t test, chi square test etc in detail and do not have examples to learn those concepts. So one would have to refer to other books to learn comcepts. Also the algorithms like decision tree, KNN etc are not explained in detail. Anyhow, this is a nice book to learn what should one learn and a ready reference to several algorithms. Overall a great collection of concepts in one place. Recommend to read."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,This book only touches the topic superficially and never refers back to the topic making the subject look mundane.

The author goes into a good deal of the mathematical background despite it being a practical book.  e.g. I finally learned the step between quadratic programming (from convex optimisation) and SVMs.That said this is not an introductory book.  You are expected to know Python and a good deal of the data libraries beforehand.
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is reasonably good at giving a high level overview of the topic and does provide more code samples on average. The problem I found was that there was often a lot of setup code that was written and just overlooked and left unexplained. Perhaps this was due to a desire to streamline the text as much as possible, but it makes the code samples much harder to understand and recreate for other purposes. Personally I would like a deeper breakdown of the code examples."

Perhaps buying directly from MIT Press is the surest way to go.With respect to the content: I really like how exercises and examples are strategically dispersed. In order to have a water-tight hold on the material, it is definitely recommended to code some of these on your own (e.g. the k-armed bandit test bed, MC, etc.) or refer to the Coursera Univ. of Albert RL course's programming assignments (that course uses this book).Note that applicability of RL to real-world problems *outside of finite-board games* is barely covered and only mentioned until Ch 16. However, this book does exceptionally well at meeting its goal: elucidating the fundamentals of modern RL."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really enjoyed working through this book. It is definitely mathematical and algorithmic in its treatment of the topics covered: Statistical ""Learning"", Monte Carlo Methods, Unsupervised ""Learning"", Regression Models, Regularization and Kernel Methods, Classification, Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods, Deep ""Learning"" ( Neural Networks )  As a statistician and data scientist, I find the convoluted ""machine learning"" terminology very affected and as helpful as trying to design a plane based on the flying dynamics of a bird.  Sometimes the rigourous mathematical notation is difficult to follow on the initial reading.  Most algorithms are implemented in Python but the code should be more clearly documented so that one can follow the implementation of the solution without getting stuck on coding issues as the book encourages the reader to focus on the algorithm and to not treat the python code as a black box.  The list of references is quite complete and it was interesting to check my library to see just how many of the references I already had.  If this book is to be used for training analysts then there should be more practical examples and code solutions available"

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It appears, the author has very vague ideas about what he is writing about. Here is just one example: definition of Markov network (page 59). ""For a set of variables ... Markov network is defined as product of potentials on subsets of variables ..."". So, Markov network is a function? Why is it called ""network""? Below he writes: ""Graphically this is represented by an undirected graph G with subsets ... being the maximal cliques in G"". The definition has nothing to do with the graph. How is this represented by a graph? The function is defined as product of potentials on some ""subsets"", why these ""subsets"" are represented as cliques graphically?I could bring many more examples of such vague and contradictory definitions. Since the definitions are such a mess, he can not say anything definite about these objects.Trying to read some more, I stuck in the next chapter, 5., section 5.1.1. ""Variable elimination in a Markov chain and message passing"". ""To develop this idea, consider the four-variable Markov chain (Markov chains will be discussed in more depth in Section  23.1)"".

My copy had a couple pages throughout that were misprinted. It appeared that the printing had been done at the wrong angle, which resulted in some of the text being cut off. This was a pretty minor issue though, and I've only come across it in a couple places throughout my reading. Overall, it is still worth the purchase."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great big book. It has every topic that is required for understanding the internal working of AI agents.Detailed discussions and simple examples make to follow through the text very easy.The topics start from very basic understanding to building the context to solving simple problems and going further deep into complex problems.Thi is The best book on Artificial Intelligence that I have purchased till now.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As a textbook, it's fine. It covers a wide range of concepts and topics in the field of artificial intelligence and is a good resource to have around.My rating is mainly based on the state of the Kindle version. There are some issues I have with it that keep me from enjoying it further.The biggest problem is the overall format. Pages aren't just digital versions of the physical pages in the real book. They're broken up into thousands of screenshot-like segments. You can't scroll ""up to the top of a page"" or ""down to the bottom"" because each page segment is only as big as your screen. This would be fine if it were a much smaller book. My tablet counts 33,261 page segments when I use it, so you can see how this might be cumbersome for such a large book.The effect of the above problem could be reduced a bit if the table of contents were complete. As it is, the table of contents is very limited in what section it allows you to ""jump"" to. The book is broken up into sections, each of which is covered in a number of chapters, as one might expect. But unfortunately, the Kindle version only lets you jump to the first chapter of each section, not any chapter in the book. This means that you either have to swipe through hundreds of page segments to get to the spot you want, or you can use the slider at the bottom of the screen and hope you land near where you want to be (the slider won't give you any additional info about where you are, either). I suppose you could swipe through it ahead of time and place book marks at each chapter header, but that shouldn't be something a reader has to do to navigate a book by its own chapters.The only other things I can think to mention have to do with resizing the screen. It's not very smooth at all. In fact, there is usually a noticeable delay when you try to resize a page segment, probably because it has to re-calculate all the page segments to fit the new zoom scale. I'm sure this could be improved if each page were just a digital version of its physical counterpart. The other problem is that the images in the book do not resize with the text. This is an especially troublesome problem for this particular book, since there are a number of intricate diagrams and images of pseudo code algorithms that are very difficult to read at this size. I can't even read some of them, and my tablet screen is larger than 10 inches.This is actually the second Kindle book I've purchased. The first one (Introduction to the Theory of Computation, by Michael Sipser) was near flawless. Each page was a digital representation of its physical counterpart, the table of contents was complete, and resizing was very smooth. I bought this AI book in Kindle form hoping for a similar experience, but I guess not all the kinks have been worked out yet. It honestly comes off feeling like a beta version that isn't quite finished. But given my experience with that other Kindle book, I know improvements can be made to this one.All that being said, I can still use the Kindle version of this book. It's just very inconvenient. If you're looking to acquire this book, I'd recommend going with the physical version, for the time being. Yeah, it's another large textbook to haul around. But it will be a lot easier to navigate and use."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The material of the book itself is great, format of printing is also great as a working textbook. It has wide outlines where one can make remarks by the pen. Also there are new definitions on the outline that boosts search experience. The one drawback I have found is that there are pages (at least I have found one already) that is printed badly: the page is squeezed by the printer (I attach a photo). It is not yet a huge problem, because in my case it is at least readable and I am not going to return the book because of that, but quality control should be better."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was curious about this topic in the overall ML domain and I stumbled on this book.The book does a great job to go deep in this topic and I love the approach it took to cover the relevant topics without going to lengthy rudimentary details that might be academic. I like the way chapters are divided into certain deep dive topics on say, how to deploy a model for a board or the code it generates, that you can revisit again later when you feel like. So, as a result, you can skip ahead, learn about a project, and again come back to review the topic to understand the details. I like this hands-on approach of this ML on a small device topic without sacrificing the quick productivity gain out of this book.Excellent jobs from the authors and I am looking forward to their next book!"

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"In my opinion, this is the best book on mathematical foundations of machine learnign there is.First: some people seem to be misunderstanding 'foundations' in the title. This is not a book about foundations in the sense that this is where you should start if you want to learn about machine learning. Rather, it is the book that you should read if you want to obtain a deep and rigorous understanding of the stuff you're doing all the time.There is one book book with a similar scope, namely ""Understanding Machine Learning"" by Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David. In contrast, the book by Mohri et al. is definitely more mathematically demanding to read (the other book clearly caters to average computer science graduate students whereas the book by Mohri et al. assumes a formal math background that a mathematics graduate (or advanced undergraduate) student is more likely to have, although in principal you can fill all the knowledge gaps you could have, from linear algebra to probability theory, optimization, information theory, and concentration inequalities, with the appendices).A difference is that Mohri's book is less heavy on frameworks and axioms (such as ""PAC-learnable"" and ""agnostic PAC-learnable""). I find this aspect a little annoying about Shalev-Shwartz's book.Another difference is that Shalev-Shwartz's book contains chapters on e.g. clustering and compressed sensing, which Mohri's book doesn't have. Although, Mohri's book does not contain a discussion of stochastic gradient descent or on neural networks. One reason could be that in general very little can be proved about those aspects and there are dedicated books for that (e.g. Calin's ""Deep Learning Architectures"", or the upcoming book ""Theory of Deep Learning"" edited by Grohs and Kutyniok, which, from what I have seen on arXiv so far, looks very promising).Mohri's book has a number of interesting sections, e.g. on kernel methods (treatment is much more thorough than in Shalev-Shwartz!), regression methods (covering e.g. fat-shattering dimension and pseudo dimension), and reinforcement learning.In contrast to Shalev-Shwartz, Rademacher complexities are introduced early on, even before the VC dimension. However, I am seriously missing a discussion of covering numbers and Dudley's theorem/chaining. Shalev-Shwartz has such a discussion, but it is too short and elementary. A more thorough treatment can be found in ""Neural network learning: theoretical foundations"" by Anthony and Bartlett (somewhat old book though, partially outdated) or in the lecture notes by Michael Wolf (can be found online).The concentration inequalities are sometimes not stated in the greatest generality possible, e.g. frequently there are boundedness assumptions on loss functions where mathematically an assumption of sub-gaussianity or sub-exponentiality would be sufficient (have a look e.g. into Martin Wainwright's book ""High dimensional statistics"" or Roman Vershynin's ""High dimensional probability"" for details).The treatment of kernels could be a little more elaborate as well, e.g. it should include a discussion of Mercer's theorem.I am giving four stars because at least covering numbers should have been included and also a short treatment of neural networks (at least classical theory such as Cybenko's theorem) wouldn't hurt. Also, sometimes I feel like this book hasn't seen enough proof-reading, there are a couple of typos and e.g. Proposition 4.3 doesn't make sense the way it is written (the k should live inside the supremum), similar withProposition 4.1 (""For any sample S"" doesn't make sense because S lives inside the probability operator). These are minor things that are forgivable, but they should have been spotted before printing.Nevertheless, this is definitely a book that anyone interested in machine learning who brings the necessary mathematical maturity should read. It is not a substitute for some machine learning book on models, such as Murphy's book (or rather books, given that the second edition will be split into two volumes). Rather, it is a complement."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m using this book as a supplement for my second ML course as part of a MSCS program. Overall, I like its math orientation. It’s good for someone going through a course that first introduces the material in other ways (instructor intro to the material). Also, it is useful for someone who may have experience with ML packages and is now seeking the corresponding mathematical foundation.If you’re new to ML, then a potential shortcoming is that the reader is left to infer from the math what things mean. So, for someone with no ML background, this could be challenging. In that case, I would recommend pairing this book with something else - to get the key ideas - and then use this book for the mathematical foundation.This isn’t a programming book, but a true computer science book. There are some other good books available if your goal is to learn a specific library or tool from a programming perspective.I read a comment about the kindle version. I am using the iOS Kindle app. In portrait mode, the equations scale to the width of the device. When rotated to landscape, it scales approximately. So, I’ve had no trouble with readability or viewing the equations iOS. I can’t speak to the native Kindle or Android Kindle experience.The reason for the 4/5 rating is because I would have liked to have seen coverage of neural networks. That was intentionally omitted and they give a reason for this decision. While I don’t think they need to try to address Deep Learning, I feel that a foundational understanding of ML should include ANNs.I am glad to have this book as a reference in my collection."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the first edition and decided to buy the second one too, because this book worth the money. If you are not sure about the purchase you can find full official PDF on the author's site and check if the book fits your expectationsYou need this book if: you are interesting in statistical machine learning and you have proper mathematical background.You do not need this book: if you are looking for a book with hands on content on deep learning and you are not interesting in the theoretical background why it actually works.A bit longer text. In the book you will find a systematic and rigorous treatment of statistical machine learning foundations (there is NO deep learning content in the book, because it's more an art than a science). Every chapter has excersizes, so the book will do for self study, although there is no publically available solution manual, at least as for now. It's important to highlight that the book is not a hands on manual, there is no codes of perceptron or regressions on keras, only pseudo code and formulas. To fully appreciate the content one needs to have a solid background in probability and linear algebra, if ""law of iterated expectations"" and ""full column rank matrix"" says you nothing, you would not enjoy the content."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought the book second-hand from the US. It assumes a lot of prior knowledge of Maths and programming. Despite high production quality, I wouldn't recommend it at all to machine learning beginners unless you are very comfortable with engineering mathematics (functions, statistics, calculus) and at least one programming language. I have already done Prof Andrew Ng's Coursera ML course, and still couldn't follow its first chapter after the first few pages. This book is intended to be the classroom text for the courses the authors take in their universities, so maybe it is not supposed to be used for self-education. It might become more comprehensible with teachers explaining things in parallel. Might be good for reference after you already know ML."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recommend this book if you wish to clearly understand why learning from data works. It provides theoretical as well as practical foundation of machine learning.I found this book to be indispensable while I took the author's MOOC on edx. I spent about 25 to 30 hours per week to understand the concepts and solve homework problems. The book covers only linear models. However, the dynamic e-chapters provided on the author's website cover neural networks, SVM, and similarity-based methods. The most important part for a machine learning practitioner is to understand the problem of overfitting. This book clearly explains the concept of overfitting and how to combat it. I use this book as a reference to design experiments to understand overfitting and model validation."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned a much loved copy of this book for several years. It does an incredibly good job of explaining why, and when, statistical learning methods work. It also introduces the mathematical prerequisites required to go out and further explore the field. Having said that, I found the topic coverage somewhat limited, and the approach surprisingly abstract. For example, there is no mention of software methods, or of popular learning models like neural networks. The text strongly hints that readers who solve the included problems will gain additional and valuable insight, but solutions to these are not readily available. This makes self study just that much harder. It's stuff like this that left me disinclined to make a strong recommendation for this book in the past.Recently I discovered an open secret that many other people seem to have known for the better part of a decade. A website associated with the book provides additional online chapters. Also included is a freely available video lecture series from one of the authors. It was recorded live in a real classroom at Caltech in 2012. The accompanying homework and final exams, with solution sets, are also available to all!The new chapters available online seemed to be written in same accessible style of the book. These chapters definitely address my complaint regarding limited topic coverage. The homework problems also seem to put a kibosh on the criticism that the book is too abstract. They seem particularly well chosen, and if you actually solve them you will definitely gain real experience with these learning techniques, all of it in the language and software platform of your choice. The solution keys tell you when you need to go back and work on a problem some more, or if you got the solution right. The video lectures I have watched are all spectacularly good. It's rare to find such a gifted teacher, and I even found myself watching him cover familiar ground just for the pleasure of observing the exposition.So, is it acceptable to give this book a ""five stars!"" rating for things that are not actually in it? I don't really know, and frankly, I think the question is irrelevant here. If you are willing to use the online resources, this book is amongst the very best introductions to machine learning available. If you choose to ignore the online resources, it is still an outstanding introduction to the mathematical foundations of the subject. While I wish there was a second edition with the new chapters, I can settle for my own printed copies of the downloaded documents for now!"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent introductory resource for understanding Machine Learning. I am reading this book in conjunction with the Author's edX course of the same name and it is immensely useful. The book is full of thought-provoking examples and problems. The theory is math-intensive but we are made to go through only what is absolutely essential for a basic understanding of the subject. E.g Hoeffding's Inequality (and its many variants) is stated and the significance of each of its terms w.r.t. the variables of the Learning Problem is clearly explained without burdening the reader with details of its derivation/proof.The book itself is a joy to behold.

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This book includes many applied examples of common real-world ML approaches implemented with popular R packages, sometimes w/ base R equivalents when available and/or appropriate. Examples are all performed using small/medium size datasets and feasible with a decent-quality personal computer. The Rmarkdown notebooks for all examples and the datasets are available via GitHub, and a free, web-only version of the text is also available. CONTENT: 4.5/5 stars.I like having a physical copy as opposed to the free online version, but the print version of this book is WAY overpriced given the production quality. I speak as a former print professional, and I know what I'm talking about here. The print version is produced entirely in black & white/greyscale. The authors/publishers made no adjustments to the color graphics of the online version, which makes plots often COMPLETELY UNREADABLE. No TRUE code highlighting either, which wouldn't be a big deal except that the authors/publishers again simply rendered the color code blocks from the online version in greyscale, yielding low-contrast code blocks that are difficult to read in less-than-bright light (and may be unreadable to some with vision impairment). It is ""hardcover"" is the sense that the cover is indeed heavyweight cardboard. However, it is perfect-bound, w/ glued-in single pages just like a paperback, NOT case-bound with saddle-sewn signatures like I would expect from a $90 ""hardback"" product. So it's basically a b&w paperback w/ a heavy cover glued on (& decent paper, I'll give them that) for $90. Compare to Wickham's Advanced R color paperback @ $35 FROM THE SAME PUBLISHER. Physical product quality: 1/5 stars given the price.Overall, 3/5 stars, a weighted average of 4.5 for content, 1 for the production quality at this price point.If you like physical copies to reference like me, I would STRONGLY suggest waiting for an edition in color & working through the free online version or choosing an alternative text. The ebook may be acceptable, I don't know.If there is a future edition or print run, the authors & publishers should consider recoloring plots for readability in greyscale & rendering code blocks as solid black text against a solid white background. Or simply producing a color, print-on-demand paperback at a reasonable price point like they did with Wickham's Advanced R. The print version as-is is a rip-off."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very steep learning curve.I almost gave up in chapter two at perceptron but since that algorithm is the foundation of all I spent a whole week to understand it. The code the author uses is pretty much optimized and it was not in sync with the mathematical introduction. But the first 30 pages are absolutely neccessary to read and understand deeply in order to move on.After page 30 it became a little faster to proceed with the book since topics from page 30 - 107 are mostly the extension of the perceptron. At page 107- 160 I am already accustomedto the authors style and to the books logic so it is now quite effective to read and digest the models.And that is where I am at the moment. I gave this book 5 stars since I wanted a high quality ML and python book which leads me through the models in a step-by-step way no matter how hard it is mathematically or programmtechnically. And I got this.negative:The pdf version has color pictures which is nice especially for multiline charts ( like page 212) where the b&w book just visually flat and some chart elements cannot be identified.

This is a nice way to reduce the complexity of explanation and getting lost in the details of the mathematics and programming syntax etc and to get at the heart of where different algorithms have strengths.This is review is from the perspective of someone who knows a little python and had little knowledge of machine learning, but has kind of seen neural nets and regressions used in different applications over the years.Part of its usefulness to me is that it gives me a nice way to explain machine learning to non-scientists."

Not only details about all algorithms, but also discusses various critical steps in preparing the data sets for ML work, evaluating the models using APIs from Scikit-Learn and Tensor Flow.Can't wait to attempt two RNN projects at the end of the book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quick delivery. Great book! One of my key references in deep learning.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a fantastic book. Very thorough in its explanations with many images to go along with it. If you read through the first chapter, you will see that the author includes all of his code online. This makes it even easier to follow along in the book; all you need to do is open up the code and see exactly what is going on."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A fantastic machine learning resource for hands-on learning! True to the title 🙂
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is definitely not for beginners as the concepts are technical both in mathematics and programming. However, author does well explaining concepts and it is very in depth. If you are looking for a career in data science and something intermediate to advanced to enhance your machine learning and data science aptitude, this is definitely a good book to go with."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a relatively new at python, and have never been associated with some of the libraries in the book.  The coding was almost immediatly over my head but was realatively easy to figure out.  Just going throught the coding and analyzing what was going on has taught me a great deal (much more than I every thought that I could) about python and the machine learning/math libraries.  If you truly want to learn, and are not afraid to put in some extra homework, I highly recommend this book."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This book has least to offer as it just pastes any code with any function from any library without even bothering to explain what they are doing. Can you believe that they have written almost nothing on feature selection like important topic!Off late I have realized that O'Reilly is such a bad publisher which is only bothered about money making...Manages biased reviews in favor and offers the least. Release a book on the name of small chapter, price it around 500-1000 rupees, and after reading that you feel you had so less and useless content wasting your time and money. Most dishonest books r coming from this publisher. Just check how they have started pricing their books insanely."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ich war bis vor Kurzem der Meinung, dass sich ein Real-Programmer nicht mit so etwas wie Python die Hände schmutzig machen sollte. In Vorbereitung für ein Projekt habe ich es mir doch näher angeschaut. Über die Sprache kann man diskutieren, aber die Bibliotheken sind wirklich brauchbar und offensichtlich auch sehr effizient implementiert (es werden good old Fortran und C Bibliotheken aufgerufen).Das Buch bietet eine ausgezeichnete Einführung in die beiden wichtigsten Statistik-Bibliotheken scikit-learn und Tensorflow. Besonders beeindruckt hat mich Kapitel 2. Es wird ein Beispiel - die Prognose von Immobilienpreisen in Kalifornien - von A-Z genau präsentiert. Man lernt auch die mundanen aber in der Praxis sehr kritischen Dinge des Statistiker-Lebens. Wie schaut man sich die Daten möglichst anschaulich an, wie reinigt man sie, beseitigt missing-values ... So etwas habe ich in diesem Detail noch nie in einem Statistik-Lehrbuch gefunden.Es werden neben dem praktischen Kode im gesamten Buch aber auch die wichtigsten statistischen Eigenschaften besprochen, der Autor diskutiert das Verhalten von unterschiedlichen Optimierungsstrategien von Tensorflow ...Es bleiben natürlich immer auch Wünsche übrig. Ich hätte mir noch etwas mehr zum Thema Time-Series und Neural Networks gewünscht. Auch auf das keras package hätte der Autor etwas detaillierter eingehen können. Das ist  offensichtlich geplant. Es gibt bereits die Ankündigung einer neuen Auflage für Juni 2019. Der Titel ist um ""keras"" erweitert.Eine gute Ergänzung zu diesem Buch ist Jake VanderPlas: Python Data Science Handbook. Mit diesen beiden Büchern erhält man eine solide Grundlage für das Gebiet. Man muss dann ""nur noch"" selber was machen und im echten Projektleben Erfahrung sammeln."

Awesome introduction covering most of the AI topics, with very easy to understand description of the concepts.While the book doesn't go in depth in any of the the major topics -- there are whole books dedicated to each (NLP, probabilistic models, machine learning, computer vision,  etc.) -- it's enough to grasp what those topics are about. At the end of each chapter it provides a very interesting and entertaining discussion of the current state of the art."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is an amazing resource to get your understanding across many different methods in line.  One of the greatest tools of a data scientist and statistician in general is knowledge of best method, or best tool, for a task.  Many solutions in data science right now go far too heavily toward one size fits all and this books helps one understand why knowing how to read your results and why to use the method to solve it really, really matter."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,I understand it is important to reduce the price of a book.  I was so enthusiast starting reading this book but the font size used for text is quite small (smaller than the font size used at the Introduction to Algorithms - by Cormen). Do I need to buy a magnifier to read this book?
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In my view, this book’s strength is the deep knowledge of the authors added by the ability to explain key points in a few sentences.I love the frequent question and answer to “Is it important for Data Scientists?” Data Science is such a wide and deep topic, that any pointers are extremely welcome.Who is this book for? I believe it’s for intermediate to advanced Data Scientists. There’s so much “wisdom” that any reader should find value in the book.The code snippets are in Python and R. Sometimes those snippets are enough (e.g. power analysis). Sometimes the reader needs different sources to dig deeper (e.g. bootstrapping where I highly recommend infer in R). I believe this “compressed” approach is smart. Data science is too wide and deep and we must be able to dig deeper on our own.In other words, for a beginner, the code is often not enough to learn a new concept. Experienced Data Scientists should be able to judge from the code snippet if it’s enough.+++ Personal highlights: +++One of the best explanations on effect size I’ve ever seen (page 135).Sometimes, the statistics community uses different terms than the machine learning community. The authors seem to understand both (page 143).For example, in the last 10 years or so, we’ve seen a trend in statistics that favors data and simulations over classical probability theory and complex tests. But why would we use permutations in a hypothesis test? On page 139, the authors explain in succinctly in two sentences.In fact, the authors have a deep knowledge of resampling and how to use simulations over classical tests.The authors don’t try to confuse you. I’ve seen new books which used two pages to explain recall and then two pages to explain sensitivity. In this book, they don’t do it. Recall is the same as sensitivity (page 223).Another example is “Power and Sample Size.” In only four pages, the reader probably gets a good idea of the four moving parts: sample size, effect size, significance level and power. This stuff is hard and explaining it well is even harder.When cluster algorithms tend to give the same results and when not.Funny: “…regression comes with a baggage that is more relevant to its traditional role …”(page 161).Why would a Data Scientist care about heteroskedasticity? Page 183.Kudos"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing book! Just what I needed to learn practical statistics for data science. Sure beats old boring and overly complicated textbooks. The codes in R and Python make it easy to compare the applicable codes in both languages. Thank you for making this book available and for sharing your knowledge. Highly recommended for professionals and students of the field.
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The content of this book is excellent. 3 stars off for (a) -1 star for extremely thin see through pages and -2 stars for poor binding that repeats pages, and has missing pages. After page 152, the book starts again at page 145, proceeds to 152 again, then jumps to page 169. So I am missing OGA 153-168 and have OGA 145-152 twice. Sad, the publisher/printers poor quality control failed the excellence of the author’s texts."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,This is my second O'Reilly book. The content thus far is very good as expected but the print quality is extremely poor compared to the other book I bought. The text is smaller than previously and all black and white which makes certain visualisations unreadable - see image below with a coloured legend which one can't understand anymore.Most egregious of all is the pages are so thin the text from other pages bleed through.Not sure if this is a cost cutting venture but you're not going to have me as a repeat customer if this is the new standard
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the book and i did learnt a lot about statistics with various python libraries. I hope it has more complete python codes and detailed step by step explanation. In short python codes and python plots could be better and I hope it can see improvement next edition. If so I will buy it again. Thanks
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a good reference book, though I'd say as it gets towards the end of the book, things get a bit complicated and difficult to internalize without practical experience.I suppose this is like a dictionary - read the first half as foundation, and for the later parts, come back to refer when actually learning/practising with those techniques."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived very quick and in perfect condition. Great book for beginner Data Science! I combine it with youtube videos and other online materials to see more examples, but it is a good book to have the plan on what to learn and in which order.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book starts by explaining each function with an example that makes sense. But it builds on these pieces as the book continues.The approach is well disciplined and pretty quickly you are building solutions. A mix of theory and code with emphasis on the latter. You won’t learn calculus but you will learn how to do it from the code.Good for those who dropped out of Andrew Ng’s courses and mortals wanting results.Me: 40 years development, MBA, and 5 years data science.  Imagining and prediction mostly."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Chris Albon has a broad and deep knowledge of data science.  This book is a treasure of hints, explanations, and examples for the use of Python and associated libraries, including Pandas, in machine learning.  It is not a text, but it much more than cheat sheets.Chris begins with common operations with arrays, vectors, and matrices -- loading, sorting, examining, analyzing, combining, modifying, transforming.  Then continues with procedures used to prepare data -- data handling, normalization, standardization, encoding categories, selecting date ranges, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and cross-validation.  Several chapters review models, including techniques for model selection, hyper-parameter tuning, performance metrics, and discussions of fitting and validation.Each topic is clearly explained and accompanied by a short, self-contained, listing of a Python (Version 3) program as illustration.I highly recommend this book to all of us who need a quick refresher related to a command or procedure."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Book is quite useful, however contains alot of coding errors. I wouldn't recommend if completely new to coding in general, however if you are confident debugging (as the errors are generally small), it is useful. Not mentioned are some of the data files which are located on the authors github account (the url links in the book don't work also)"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great resource for quick and insightful tips for your machine learning challenges. As the author states, you do need to have python and machine learning experience to get maximum benefit from this book. I would argue that even those with less Machine Learning experience can learn a lot from the first 8 chapters. Chapters 9-21 are definitely best suited for someone that does have some experience using scikit-learn.Bottom line, this is a useful resource to have next to your computer when those machine learning problems pop up in your day to day work."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been studying data science during this pandemic; and since it has been a while since I graduated from college, my brain hasn't been as analytically sharp as I wanted it to be. And like many others, I've scoured the Internet to supplement what I have been studying. I've found many; but Chris's web site was the most organized and lucid to follow, with pertinent comments for practically every code. Hence each exercise is explained clearly. I realized I don't always have access to the Internet, so I decided to purchase the book. More power to Chris in helping us less mortals understand machine learning!"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great book for ML concepts and I love the example scripts the author provided that really help readers to follow along.  The author explains each algorithm in a very concise and clear way. I personally think it's way better than some other bestselling ML book on Amazon. I refer to this book as my ML bible all the time. Love it!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A very nice introduction to Machine Learning. I do not understand all of it as it can be quite dense at times, but I have gotten a lot out of this book. I like that it is only a few chapters, so reading it cover to cover is actually feasible. And you feel a sense of accomplishment when you have done so. This is a book a plan to keep on my shelf, and I will reread it soon to get some of the concepts I missed in my first pass. Thank you to the authors for pricing this book reasonably."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is a very good place to get started in understanding machine learning. It's by no means a complete picture of all the myriad of techniques, but it's not supposed to be (look to Hastie for that). It does give a solid probabilistic treatment of why machine learning should work, and why it can often fail. I strongly recommend this to any one whom is trying to understand what's under the hood in machine learning. This book also compliments the video lectures from Caltech well (I think that was the point). The topics overlap a little but there are many expanded explanations of the core concepts in this book that are covered hastily in the lectures."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The treatment of the subject in the book can be summarized using a sentence from the book itself - ""Learning from Data is an empirical task with theoretical underpinnings"". The book does a great job at explaining the basic principles of linear models (perceptron, linear regression, logistic regression), non-linear models (kernel tricks) and how they derive from one another. It is aimed at a mathematically sophisticated audience - for example, it provides mathematical justification for cross-validation. While the math can be hard to plow through, it does end up giving you some solid insights into the learning process and the various techniques discussed that would probably not have been as easy to understand intuitively."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"In addition to Dr. Mostafa's course, this book is the best resource for a computer science student or a future machine learning practitioner to learn the basics of machine learning. Foundations of the subject are treated both from an intuitive perspective and from a mathematically rigorous perspective in a very clear manner. The focus is on supervised learning. The reader should be proficient in basic calculus, linear algebra and probability. Highly recommended."

For me, reading the book was an excellent way to solidify my understanding of the material, and I've looked some bits up on occasion."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the worst faults of most mathematics texts is that they often have idiosyncratic notation methods. When that happens, many times the reader is required to guess or worse, try to ignore the unknown and move along.Abu-Mostafa included a comprehensive glossary in the book so that you can easily find out what any particular variable means. An appendix like this should be required of all math books by law.A huge and unexpected surprise was the web site devoted to the book which includes a community of very smart and helpful students. You can log in and join in the converssation as if you were in class.I couldn't be happier with the purchase."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used many of the mainstream machine learning textbooks including Bishop, Murphy, Alpaydin, Mitchell. IMHO, this short introductory book provides the best and most clear foundation to understanding machine learning. I recommend reading even if you are already quite knowledgeable about the subject as I humbly predict it will likely provide additional and/or missing insights into the why of fundamental techniques."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this for class (required). The book is not dry technical reading at all (it's almost like the authors are real people and they have senses of humor or something!). I've only read the first chapter so far, but it seems to be a great machine learning book. It's small and you don't have to fork out 100+ dollars. There's also an online forum specific to the book that seems to be fairly active and helpful. I know that at least one of the authors of the book (my professor) peruses the forum fairly frequently."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is quite good. Normally, I only buy used books (to save money). Since this book is so new, I could not find it used. Hence I bought it new at full price. I was wary of the expenditure and the content. After a minute or two reading the book, I changed my mind. This book is clearly worth the price. The level of technical content (AI and Python) is quite high. Anyone with a background in programming (hopefully Python programming) will learn a ton from this book. Of course, you need the right tools to use this book (a PC with a graphics card). However, it you have the tools you will get more than what you paid for."

Women will succeed to the same degree as men once we all acknowledge the non representation of great women in all fields historically was due to lack of opportunity or publicity. Not because men are better at stuff."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have already recommended this book as required reading to every person (including many complete strangers on the train)  that I know.It fills me with equal parts rage and hope (nah... More rage) to read how women have been designed into invisibility and objectification for all of human history. You will feel the same.And then you'll do something about it.Read this book.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's great that someone's written a book about Feature Engineering and it contains a lot of interesting material. I also like that clear readable coding examples are included (Python), so that the reader can try at home.But, it feels unfinished. The book is pretty short and the set of topics seems more like what the authors were interested in than a survey of the field. The level of explanation varies from super-detailed to glossing over concepts and technical terms that most readers won't know.The biggest issue is that the graphics are mostly hand-drawn on some kind of tablet and look like they were scrawled out quickly. I've attached one example. As you can see, they didn't even bother to adjust the contrast. So, the images have a dull gray background. Disappointing that O'Reilly didn't take care of this for the authors."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit:I now have the book and obviously the equation problem below is absent. To give full credit to the scientific content over the Kindle issue - this is an extremely interesting book that presents a bigger technical context around ML, as well as presenting main themes in ML. I don't know any other text that frames the science/math in this way and it's  clear and well-explained and gives plenty of food-for-thought. There are accompanying Youtube videos, so one can switch between the book and videos. Highly recommended.---This book has superb and interesting content, but the equations are tiny both on Kindle For Mac and on Kindle on an iPad. I estimate that the equation font is half the size of the main text font / the equation number at the end of the line, which I doubt is intentional. I persevered with it for a day but, given there are many equations with subscripted variables, and summations with indices at top and bottom etc, it was a painful reading experience and I returned it.---"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is an absolutely spectacular introduction to the state of the art in modern data driven engineering. This field is rapidly taking center stage with the ubiquity of data-gathering devices and the exponential increase of computation in everyday workstations.The aspiring engineer and the experienced professional have something to learn here. This book is unique in that it provides easily adaptable code and conceptually accessible explanations for the beginner, while also depicting advanced methods to tantalize the more advanced researcher.Definitely requires a working knowledge of linear algebra and some real and complex analysis to fully benefit, but the corresponding YouTube lectures make this easily accessible for the advanced engineering undergraduate, or graduate in other fields."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have you ever encountered that one textbook your uni recommends that is really theoretical, full of equations, diagrams (which I like) BUT is written in a way that is boring? Well, this one comes without the ""BUT .."" section. It provides theoretical content in a way that is really fun to read and easy to implement. It is about 400 pages of information, they also included at the end of each chapter some papers and texts worth reading which is nice(I write this because, I 've encountered textbooks worth more than this, some good some bad, that don't recommend papers or other textbooks for further reading).It's not easy to find books that find you in line with your preferences. This one is the type of books I loved reading through the end and felt the urge to write a good review."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've read the first 6 chapters of this book.  The coverage of the material is superficial, there is a host of typos, the reasoning is tortured, and breaking up the code means there appears to be missing segments.  The choice to use MATlab is pretty strange, too.  Python is ubiquitous, just go with that.  On the other hand, the book does do a decent job of introducing you to the jargon and some concepts (again, superficially).  It might be a good data science in MATlab reference, too.That said, the videos that accompany the book are quite good.  Far superior to the book itself.  They are available for free on YouTube.  If you have the time to watch those videos, you like what you see, and you want a text reminder of the material, buy this book.  Otherwise, look elsewhere."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The book is really full of neat explanations and uses a clear language. The mathematical foundations are very well tackled and the code is well commented and explained. It will be much better if the codes were written in Python but most of them can be easily implemented in Python.

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The content of this book gets 5 stars. I especially appreciate the author including Python this time around. However, O'Reilly decided to print this book in black and white.

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I read through a previous version of this book when I was mainly using R, and it was incredible. One of the better stats application books I've read. Since I switched to Python this year, I was very happy to see that they released a version with Python content. However, I've thus far been very disappointed. The stats content is still great, but overall, the Python code is very often missing comments, doesn't run properly, or some mix of both. The book is still a good primer on the stats that a data scientist needs, but don't expect the code snippets to provide much guidance."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,The book is well thought out and the explanations of the concepts are sound.  The subtitle is a little misleading giving the impression that the book covers both R and Python equally.  The reality is that is puts much more emphasis on R programming language and the Python code is an after thought.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is best stats book I have ever read. The authors emphasize the practical application of statistical concepts to data. Too many statistics books follow a traditional coverage path through probability theory, set theory, classical statistics, etc. If you are someone who prefers to understand the meaning behind statistical tools and applications before getting down into the mathematical weeds, then this is perfect for you. However, if you prefer a more bottom-up, mathematically rigorous approach then feel free to skip this."

I picked this book up as a refresher, and not only did it succinctly describe all and a bit more of what I learned in those courses, but it has excellent ""further readings,"" great clarifying synonym lists when it defines ""key terms,"" and is very readable.  Literally blown away."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This was purchased as a companion text to the Stanford Into to AI online class taught by the authors. The text is a great complement to the class.  The class works through a lot of examples and clarifications on how to apply concepts.  The book provides the formal definitions, a lot more words and depth to the material covered in the classroom.The book covers a lot of ground even for ~1000 pages.  The book does a great job of maintaining a uniform level of detail.  The class does a better job of ordering the material than the text.  Fortunately, the text is well written without accumulating a lot of jargon, such that you can skip around from one chapter and topic to the next in order to follow the classroom lectures without getting lost in jargon.If you are taking the class, get the book.  If you are new to AI and trying to wade through this book, definitely sign up for the class."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Full disclosure - I'm an AI novice. However, after reading Real World AI, it's abundantly clear that the responsible use of AI is a complex and delicate process. Despite that fact, the real-world stories (from many titans in the tech industry) that the authors expertly weave throughout this book are captivating, and help to present and illustrate the important concepts in a way that is both approachable and easily understood.A major compelling point that the authors drive home is that if the technology is not implemented correctly by people, the mistakes and biases in our past can very easily shape our future in unintended or unanticipated negative ways. With that being said, this guide is a must read for data scientists and business folks alike - to ensure that these mistakes can be avoided from the start, and to understand the impact that these critical decisions have on shaping the final outcome of your project or product."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When it comes to the realities of an AI and Machine Learning strategy, no stone is left unturned by these knowledgable authors. Most interesting to me were all the real-world examples of companies that have used AI. Each example carries an important lesson for readers."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Responsible AI, as the name aptly describes is a thought-provoking book about the importance of applying AI in a responsible way. This book takes the reader through many real life examples of how well meaning intent of people and companies failed to deliver results through AI.  The author, Alyssa’s, willingness to be candid and vulnerable about her own 1st time experience where she created unintended bias shows that she deeply cares about the topic.  It was eye opening to read how AI is all around us but as users of products and services you often don’t think of the technology that powers them.  This book motivated me to learn more about AI (I did have to Google some of the technical terminology used in this book).  My professional takeaway was that I don’t have to be a data scientist to be in the AI space, instead I can use my existing skills as a product leader to leverage this technology:- aligning a cross-functional team to a common business goal, outcome and measurement- continue with an Agile mindset of delivering, reviewing feedback and iterating. The iterating is especially important when it comes to training the data. Given that our world is not static, it’s imperative that the AI data be retrained to an evolving world- Garbage in, garbage out still holds true so focus on the quality and diversity of the training dataAs AI continues to get deeply ingrained in our day to day, it is our moral responsibility to understand and start conversation about developing this technology ethically and mindfully so we can leave a better world to future generations"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very concise and easy-to-understand book. If you want to understand how to implement AI to add value to your business, without diving into all the jargons and complicated stuff, then this is the right book to start.Also, many of the concepts outlined in this book applies not only to AI projects, but to any other project that a company is considering to carry out as a way to improve its value to customers.I really enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone interested in this topic."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Alyssa and Wilson do a fantastic job creating a truly practical guide for deploying responsible AI. The language is clear and complex topics are broken down into digestible bits. Both authors share stories from their personal experiences, and they unpack some of the most infamous AI challenges that organizations have faced.Before believing that AI is the silver bullet for your business and buying into AI hype, read this book to understand how to define your AI strategy, build the right organization, identify the pilot problem, and scale successfully."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As someone tech savvy but very much at ""entry level"" when it comes to AI, this book made for an incredibly compelling read. Often books addressing technical subject matter rapidly alienate me as a reader as they are dense, overly complex and (occasionally) reek of self importance. This book is NOT that.Accessible, easy to read and intensely practical, 'Real World AI' provides a fantastic guide to the world of machine learning and how to leverage it for meaningful application, rather than using it as a shiny new thing to show off, without having any real substantial use in your business.Alyssa and Wilson bring their wealth of experience to this book in a generous, thoughtful and compelling way. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who wants to burst the bubble on AI as a buzzword and learn more about how it can impact our businesses and our world in a myriad of exciting new ways."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are a growing number of books out there about AI, but most of them are either too technical or too academic for the large numbers of CEOs, product managers, data scientists working to apply AI to their business. This book helps turn abstract notions into real-world examples, and, most importantly, it keeps a responsibly AI lens throughout the conversation. Increasingly, people working on delivering AI models need to no just make it work in the real world, but also make sure it is designed to work for everyone, and built using a fair supply chain - from data sourcing, to governance, to privacy and security, to paying attention to any biases. You'll definitely find threads in the book to guide you on your journey."

My version of this large tome is well worn and noted.This large volume is one of two volumes that are my first, go-to books while i am coding. I will go to this (and ""Python Data Science Essentials"" by Boschetti & Massaron) before I go to Google or StackOverflow.com for answers. My version is heavily tabbed and used. This book provides a great starting place to research how-to do a piece of code and what can be done with bits of code to achieve the end for which I am looking.For anyone in Python, short of being a Python Genius, THIS is a must have book on your shelf and a must-refer-to book in your Python library at the moment (2018)."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Full of practical examples and detailed explanations. Can't be better!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is a phenomenal resource. It might very well be in a league of its own. In my opinion there are a handful of machine learning books that I've come across that really stand out from the rest: Introduction to Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani), Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshiani), Applied Predictive Modeling (Kuhn, Johnson), Python Machine Learning (Raschka), and then this book. I've also heard great things about Machine Learning: A Probabilisitc Perspective (Murphy) and Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop), though I haven't yet read those texts. ISL, APM, and PML each are terrific with a blend of theoretical but mostly geared towards practical applications. ESL is more focused on theory and a deep understanding of the math behind the algorithms/functions (i.e. how do they work, which is essential for understanding when to apply which algorithm). This text is different in that it's more focused on the problem of learning: is learning possible? how do we learn? and how do we learn well? This is an essential foundation that everyone in the field needs to have.The text is impressive in and of itself; however, what really makes this book stand out is that the authors have set up a website dedicated to the text with a blog, dynamic e-chapters (covering NN, SVM, Similarity Methods, Linear Algebra, and various techniques to aid in learning (i.e. dimension reduction)). Its much like a virtual classroom where you may ask questions regarding the book or anything ML in general and other reviewers and the text authors are there to answer your questions. There are very high quality videos (lectures) along with slides for each chapter. Thus, when you buy the text you gain access to each of these resources (lectures are free on YouTube whether you purchase the book or not). ISL also has its own course online with lecture videos (which can be found on YouTube). I would say that anyone who is starting out in the field needs these two texts: LFD and ISL. From each you get your theory and practical foundations along with lectures and learning resources. The back of the book also contains a very comprehensive dictionary of notations used throughout the book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm just finishing up the Caltech on-line course for this book.  I really like this, both the book and the course. The explanation is very clean and clear. It's the only elementary book I've ever seen that explains the VC dimension and the theory of generalization.There are lectures on YouTube supporting it as well.  If you buy the book there are additional fascicles available on the web site."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great book that puts things in perspective and simplifies the big picture of machine learning. Beautifully written and presented. I highly recommend for every graduate student or professional pursuing a field in machine learning. You can couple that with Prof. Yaser Abu-Mostafa's lectures on Youtube to get double the benefit.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read the book, it's a good introduction to the word of learning from data (you can call it data science);  despite being an introductory book, it gives a quite deep understanding of problems at the core of the learning, like the question whether one has to expect a result to generalise outside the training set, how to avoid overfitting,..."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book should be used in combination with the titular MOOC taught by Abu-Mostafa at Caltech. Fantastic lectures, acceptable problem sets, and a great read. The math is intermediate-undergraduate level, meaning that it requires minimal knowledge of linear algebra and probability, but you could get away with high school level math."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an incredibly well thought out book. It is gripping, easy to understand, and keeps you following the mathematics without patronising you. The authors are experts in well-placed visuals to illustrate tricky concepts — visuals they must have spent a lot of time conceiving, designing and developing.Many scholars forget how difficult it was to learn what they know understand well, and as a result communicate it poorly. They may even feel that confusion and immersion are 'rites of passage'. Abu-Mostafa and colleagues seem to greatly dislike this approach, perhaps even feeling that it is an excuse for poor educational resources. Instead set out to make a top-rate learning experience, and fill a significant machine learning gap. The book is even humorous at times, which contributes greatly to bonding with students. They have certainly succeeded in their ambitions.Those on the textbook writing road, even if they aren't seeking to learn from data, could learn much from this stellar pedagogical work."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is really great for engineers who want an intro to machine learning.Clearly the target audience is for the practicing engineer without a math degree.Just enough of the required math is used to explain the theory along with word description of what is going on.It avoids the convoluted gobbly-gook you see in technical papers that makes things impossible to followfor the average engineer.The book concisely lays things out step by step though you have to put effort to follow it.The goal of this book is to give the reader a solid foundation for further study on machine learning.This book is not a cookbook on how to implement machine learning.Prof Abu-Mostafa lectures and class material are excellent and are posted on[...]Clearly this book is the first edition as there are additional e-chapters posted on additional topicswhich will most likely be included in a future edition of this book.  The book will show you how to access the additional chapters.On the back cover it says ""This is a short course, not a hurried course."" And this is true.It is short because things are concisely presented.  However, it is not hurried as I needed a lot of time to digest it.You'll need to know some multivariable calculus and linear algebra to follow along, and some programming skills to dosome of the exercises in the book.Overall an excellent intro to machine learning."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great book if you want to get started with machine learning. This is not a book where you will find lots and lots of methods used or not used in practice (like Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie or Machine Learning Probabilistic Perspective by Murphy). This book will help you understand the theory of machine learning and give some very important practical advice.Bias variance trade off is covered very nicely here.I love the dedicated chapter on ""Overfitting"". Overfitting explanation is great. Overfitting plots illustrate the trade off between the number of data samples that you have and the complexity of the hypothesis set that you should choose."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book builds linkages between statistics and machine learning, which confused me a lot in the past. Well-written and well-organized. I would recommend this book to all machine learning lovers."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent book. Explains the basic mathematics behind machine learning in an understandable and consistent manner. The book is a little light on proofs, so if that is important I would suggest looking elsewhere. The book is excellent as a first introduction to machine learning."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book should be mandatory to read in schools, as it uses data to illustrate unconscious bias and it’s consequences. This book does not say that men intentionally exclude women, but rather that without women being involved in the processes their needs are often just not realised."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes you see issues in a completely different light. Very dense with statistics at times but necessary to give weight to the arguments. Narrative of male as representing the norm threads throughout. Makes you feel angry and a bit hopeless but such an important book.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good book so far (I'm halfway through it).
,3.0 out of 5 stars,Author writes an entire book on how to use data science and ML to secure your resources and sums it up by literally saying that there are no defenses against attacks that target ML.  Maybe it’s just me but when I read a book and someone suggests all these novel ways to protect my network and then at the end says there’s really no defense it’s strikes me as odd.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s a good book for both tech and non-tech persons. For tech persons it’s a good reference book for the approach we can consider to make use of machine learning to enhance security, and refer to the sample code for hands on.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy book to read and very inspiring for anyone interested in algorithm's
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a grad student, I can say that the book introduced almost no new technical concepts or algorithms, but I hadn't bought it for the purpose anyway. In contrast, the book is very useful when it comes to understanding the bigger picture: from the systematic comparison between the different schools of machine learning, to the guided tour through their respective histories, and finally to the extensive discussion of how the different parts are related and can potentially be combined, the book is a very smooth ride into the world of machine learning.I tended to disagree with the author during the last part of the book, where he discusses different points related to the future of AI. The author comes over as too optimistic at times, and/or oversimplifies many important aspects. But this concerns only the last chapter, which doesn't constitute the core of the book's topic, so it can be ignored.The biggest bonus is perhaps the author's elaboration on his work unifying logic and Bayesian learning. Though I had read his early academic papers on Markov Logic Networks, I found it nice that the author tells his personal journey that lead to that academic work. And there are a lot of useful insights too.Finally, the language of the book makes it almost read like a fantasy saga; albeit a very small one."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Das ist für Laien schwere Kost, da Pedro Domingos sehr in die Details der fünf unterschiedlichen Ansätze des Maschinellen Lernens einsteigt. Dennoch lesenswert als Einstieg in eine Thematik, die für unser aller Leben entscheidende Bedeutung hat. Negativ finde ich den Eindruck, dass alle Probleme dieser Welt durch den noch zu findenden Master-Algorithmus gelöst werden sollen. Da bin ich entschieden anderer Meinung. Ich wünsche mir eine Management Fassung für die Politik, die täglich über die Digitalisierung schwafelt, aber offensichtlich nicht weiß, worum es geht. Diese Beurteilung maße ich mir an, nachdem ich mich durch diese Tour de force der KI gearbeitet habe. Einen Einstieg in die Denke Pedro Domingos gibt sein kürzlich geführtes Interview im Spiegel. Wo wir heute stehen: Während meines Luberon-Urlaubs wollte ich genauer wissen, wie Übersetzer-Programme das schöne französische ""village perchee"" übersetzen. Das sind diese alten Orte, die hoch auf Felsen sitzen (Berg- oder Adlernest). Das neuronale Netz von DeepL (letzter Schrei der Übersetzerprogramme und angeblich Meilen vor Google translate) schafft es zu: Dorf mit Sitzgelegenheit. Man sieht wie weit wir noch von der von Domingos herbeigesehnten Zukunft entfernt sind, vom Babelfisch zu schweigen."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This book hardly ever exceeds the iInformation content of long magazine articles. Written for the broad masses, it lists some examples of AI, names 5 Schools of AI, and refers to other popular books on the Topic.Even for non-Computer scientists there is little to learn from this book.Perhaps useful for children."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ce livre dresse un panorama global des technologies utilisées en Machine Learning. C'est vu à grande vitesse et haute altitude, mais relativement exhaustif et l'auteur connait son sujet.Malheureusement comme beaucoup de ces livres de vulgarisation US, il dit en 3 pages ce que l'on peut dire en une et le tout est noyé dans des tas de digressions et d'exemple souvent triviaux qui n'apportent pas grand chose et sont sensés rendre la technique plus assimilables.Si vous voulait acquérir des notions solides (sans descendre trop dans le détail de la mise en oeuvre), prenez un livre plus technique mas pas trop,.Si vous voulez juste un panorama global et pas trop technique trouvez une bonne revue ou un article d'initiation.Ce livre tombe entre les deux et est donc un peu ""inutile"".: trop verbeux pour un survol général, pas assez technique pour une compréhension profonde.La partie la plus intéressantes pour moi : les annexes avec la bibliographies afférente à chaque chapitre et l'aspect historique qui resitue chaque école dans son contexte chronologique."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Aunque no describe los algoritmos en detalle, y desde luego sin aparato matemático, sí da una visión amplia de sus diferentes familias y sus aplicaciones. Es muy recomendable para identificar las tendencias y aquellas soluciones que funcionan y donde. Ahora, el que haya un único algoritmo para todo como defiende, es probable que no esté al alcance de la tecnología y el conocimiento actual. Lo mismo que la gravedad y la cuántica no se han podido reconciliar en los últimos decenios. Pero por intentarlo, no se pierde nada."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been in AI for more than 40 years. I know, I know, I am old, and I have seen just about everything in this area of science. My 1985 Ph.D. was one of the first in the area of Associative Memories (a field related to earlier AI ideas). That said, this book has quickly become my favorite! So concise, so clear and clever! If you want to understand where we are in the AI research these days, READ THIS BOOK! Read it and then take Pedro Domingo's COURSERA video course! I do not want to spoil your enjoyment by telling you much about the Master Algorithm, but what I can tell you is that it reads like Da Vinci Code! It is full of humor and intrigue. Wonderful book from a rising star in machine learning!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to the other books I read on the topic „Artificial Intelligence“ this is the one which concentrates (up to my personal reading experience, see reviews) on 300 pages most on the technological background how to achieve the feat of an „ultimate learning machine“. The whole course is then closed with an outlook what a potential world with this kind of machine might look like. But the author reminds the curious reader, that we are all already experiencing and use learning programs, that they are not only part of our daily life, but also more and more influencing our decisions, not only in the way which ads are displayed while surfing the web.I really enjoyed reading the book, what I especially liked is the overview of the different thought schools (and the related theories and ways to approach the issue „AI“ underneath) which are actually in the play on the big, growing field of „Artificial Intelligence“. Several times, other authors are cited, their way of thinking approached from a different angle (e.g. Max Tegmark), so it almost „feels“ like listening to a scientific discussion.Comparing the „fun“ factor to read the book, Mr. Domingo presents the topics with a little more seriousness in the way of writing compared to Mr. Tegmark, Kurzweil or Russel, but I can recommend this book for everybody who has a serious interest in the topic of „Artificial Intelligence“ and the further potential impacts it will bring to our life. It will certainly not teach you how to program the „Master Algorithm“, but it will help to understand which topics are the ones the current mainstream researchers are pursuing."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bon livre même si Pedro Domingos n’est pas un champion de la pédagogie… Par ailleurs, il met un ou deux chapitres inutiles avant de démarrer. Cela m’a fait penser au livre « The vital question » de Nick Lane. L’un (Lane en biologie) et l’autre (Domingos en intelligence artificielle) présentent l’état de l’art et les pistes de leur recherche pour une théorie du tout. Si on ne s’attarde pas trop sur les détails plus ou moins clairs des différents chapitres, on finit par avoir une bonne vue d’ensemble des techniques de machine learning, leurs forces et leurs limites. Enfin le dernier chapitre est une très bonne surprise, avec de nombreuses idées et un bon sens citoyen qui, en quelques pages, dépassent en originalité et en richesse tout le Homo Deus de Harari."

I mean it explains almost everything and it is those kinds of books that you keep as reference if you want to get an understanding on how things work on a specific technique before venturing deeper into it or wasting time online. Then, of course if you want to impement something or develop your competence more on a certain subjects than others, well you need a follow-up read.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the most promising books in introductory machine learning. Definitely recommend this book for those who are interested in machine learning from Bayesian point of view. I use this book as a reference book along with pattern recognition book by Bishop for my graduate class in Bayesian ML.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is meant for Machine Learning practitioners who want to understand the fundamentals. Diagrams are clear and to the point. I do not understand why there are only 12 reviews. The book is really good. Please look through the table of contents carefully and you will realize you have more than what is required. The book can be used for graduate courses on Machine learning. The only thing I hate is the lack of colorfulness of the book. When you are reading mathematical equations, colorful diagrams help you develop intuition just like those in Kevin Murphy's ML book. Very comprehensive. I recommend this book."

There are many problems at the end of each chapter, but not even any hints of how to solve them.  There is a set of multiple choice questions and answers at the end of the book; these challenge only the students ability to memorize definitions."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"There is nothing interesting in the book about finance. The book essentially covers some ML approaches with advanced mathematical exposition with little practical examples. Limited in scope and mostly good as an academic reference point for certain ML approaches.The book takes some ML approaches to a more advanced mathematical treatment --- that's it !!! Nothing else nothing more. Barely of any help in practice.  They fail to go from theory to practice, in the sense of providing coding examples for each ML algorithm. There are a few examples as supplementary material, but this is just to lure purchases of the book than are of any real value. In many pages, there are distracting multiple-choice questions with little pedagogical value as well.Again, there more interesting books out there -- and the word ""finance"" in the title is a gimmick. Using examples from Finance does not mean that the book is *for finance* applications.Don't buy unless you want to have a book in your library that has some good references to the literature."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a decent understanding of Machine Learning, and wanted to know more about its applications in Finance. It has been a very useful book, as it is rare to find books covering applications of ML in Finance. The best part about this book is that, it also covers various foundational disciplines like Maths & Statistics wherever I felt there was a need for it.I like the fact that it comes with exercises at the end of chapters, and quite a lot of code samples that can be readily executed to understand the concepts. Colour images are a big bonus too.There was a minor issue, 4 or 5 of the colour images, have black text on very dark backgrounds, hence making them unreadable, luckily many of these can be read by executing the code samples, so, it was not a big issue for me. I would have deducted about 0.25 stars for the image issue, but I can't do that, and it is otherwise an excellent addition to my learning.I believe that it will also be equally good for Finance professionals who want to know about Machine Learning, while I belong to the ML group wanting to learn it's applications in Finance."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just started to read the book and I have found it to be very informative for people with interests and background in quantitative finance. Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and specially Reinforcement Learning is currently a focus point of research as there has been interesting breakthroughs, e.g. DeepMind's AlphaGo. Financial industry is also benefiting from the machine learning advancements, specially when non-traditional alternative data are available, e.g. sentiment-based trading or natural language processing.The book authors have extensive experience and background in quantitative finance. The book aims to presents the machine learning subject for quantitative finance professionals and graduate students in quantitative disciplines, e.g. Mathematics, Physics, Statistics. The book is divided to three parts: Machine Learning with Cross-Sectional Data, Sequential Learning, and Sequential Data with Decision-Making. Each part encompasses relevant topics presented in a few chapters where each chapters is accompanied by corresponding reference aiding interested readers to dive into the chapter's material. The book is also accompanied with a collection of Python codes to further facilitate the learning process.For readers with knowledge of option pricing, optimal hedging  the reinforcement learning part of the book provides the dynamic programming approach toward relevant classical option pricing problems through reinforcement learning closely resembling the celebrated Black-Scholes-Merton model.Overall, the book is valuable resource for Quants to become acquainted with the emerging Machine Learning Applications in Finance.  The book should be  helpful to the whole Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence community, and in particular to quants community in financial industry."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Traditionally finance industry uses mathematical approaches on so-called from ""quantitative finance"" perspective.  Dixon-Halperin-Bilokon's refreshing book does not only capture specialised usage of machine learning in finance but it also serves as a machine learning reference book. They treat chapters in great substance with carefully covering basic concepts in a non-superficial manner."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is a reference for financial machine learning. I started reading it and it is complete and well detailed.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An amazing and comprehensive presentation of many different relevant and useful concepts.  The finance industry -- trading, asset management, risk management, banking, etc -- is most likely going to look much different in the not too distant future and much of this change is going to come from applications of this book's concepts.  The authors also do a great job of demonstrating that these ""black boxes"" are actually not mysterious and overly complicated but rather fairly intuitive and implementable.  If anyone has ever seen the movie ""AlphaGO"" and was wondering how that type of paradigm shift would apply to finance, the next step is to buy this book."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The authors cut through the hype and rebranding that litters the field of machine learning.  They discuss models that are relevant to finance.  Most importantly for professionals, they ground their discussion in concepts that will be familiar to statisticians and numerical analysts (quants, in other words).Some of the work presented in this book is new, particularly the sections on inverse reinforcement learning.This will be an excellent resource for a graduate course.  Those students who do not have the math background will likely be motivated to get it.  There are well-designed Python notebooks that present examples of the analysis.  Students with the ability to work with the concepts presented in this book would be welcome in any serious quant shop."

So -1 star for content.Reading this book in Kindle format is not good. The Kindle reader apps are optimized for novels and not technical books. The formatting for example code is just terrible. Often details in diagrams are too small to distinguish and the Kindle app offers no way to view just a diagram. There is also no easy way to move from different locations in the book quickly. So -2 for crummy Kindle experience."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good book. Very clear and concise!!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is one of the best book I have read so far on Machine Learning. My favorite part is the PAC learning and the need for theory of generalization. I also watched the videos available from the author Dr.Yaser  and in one word he is marvelous. This is definitely the book I will recommend to anyone if  it is her first course on Machine Learning.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great introduction recommended by an excellent video series I found on YouTube.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this book to accompany the Cal Tech Machine Learning online course at iTunes U (it's also available elsewhere). This course is entirely theory and in my opinion it is an excellent introduction to the subject of Machine Learning. I have been reading the text and watching the lectures concurrently. All of the online presentations are from the book, but there is additional information in the book which has clarified a few sketchy areas for me. You do not need to watch the lectures, but I have found them helpful and enjoyable. I obtained a computer science degree in 1987 (yeah, that's not a typo) and I have throughly enjoyed this book and the lectures as an introduction to a new topic in computer science. In my opinion, after reading and learning the theoretical underpinnings of Machine Learning from this book a developer would be ready to do meaningful work in the area."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning From Data by Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa et al is good intro to both a theoretical and practical approach to understanding modeling. Let’s make things clear, this is a textbook – not a passive read. At about 200 pages, it on the slim side for a textbook, but as the authors note in the preface, the book is “a short course, not a hurried course”.Complexity:Despite not having much modeling experience, the book was relatively easy for me to understand, although some of it did go over my head. It is a very good choice as an introduction to the field. The authors do an incredible job of weaving narrative into the knowledge early on, although this becomes less common later in the book. By that I mean most sections contain examples relating the topic to real life applications which prevents the math from becoming too abstract. And there is a good amount of math. Before reading this book, I would recommend having taken multivariable calculus since they use gradients and other things fairly frequently. If you have taken enough math but think you are a bit rusty the book takes care of that. The authors have been kind enough to include a “Table of Notation” at the back of the book to let you refresh yourself if you come across an unfamiliar symbol. So if you forget what a downward pointing triangle means, there is still hope for you!Chapter 1: The Learning Problem.In this chapter the authors provide the basic background to learning from data. As stated earlier, this is where they do some of their best work connecting the theory to real life examples. The writing style in some of these examples is almost like prose which makes it a much more enjoyable and memorable read. They summarize some of the main types of learning and define some of the key terms and principles like error and noise.Chapter 2: Training versus Testing.This chapter begins to explain what the theory of generalization is, the associated error, and numerical approximations of generalizations. I would still categorize this chapter as background knowledge that will be used more in later parts of the book.Chapter 3: The Linear Model.This is really the meat of the book. If you want to quickly learn how to do a regression then jump straight to this chapter. It covers both linear and logistic regression and also touches on nonlinear transformations.Chapter 4: Overfitting.This chapter deals with the more advanced aspects of modeling. As the authors put it “the ability to deal with overfitting is what separates professionals from amateurs”. While I can safely say that I am still an amateur, it was nice to be exposed to some of the more advanced concerns of the field. Overfitting, for those who don’t know, is trying to fit to the data more than is needed. This is often done by using more degrees of freedom than necessary to make a model i.e. making a 10th order approximation of data whose original function is actually only 2nd order. To someone new to modeling it can be very tempting to increase the order of an approximation because it might seem that higher order = higher accuracy. This section of the book does a good job of explaining how that isn’t the case by introducing the idea of an overfit penalty, the increase in error from overfitting a curve.Chapter 5: Three Learning Principles.This chapter is different. Very different. Instead of continuing to introduce other types of models, the authors decide to use the fundamentals taught in earlier chapters to talk about three key principles that are useful in modeling: Occam’s razor, sampling bias, and data snooping. Occam’s razor is something that is well-known. The book uses Albert Einstein’s explanation of the term, “An explanation of the data should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.” This relates to the previous chapter’s problem of overfitting. Sampling bias talks about errors in modeling that come from having data that is not representative of the overall population. Data snooping talks about deciding to make a prediction after looking at data rather than before. This section was probably the most interesting to read. Unlike the previous few chapters the authors return to relying on real world examples. They even use the historical example of the false prediction of the 1948 US presidential election between Truman and Dewey. Again this makes the information in this chapter much more memorable and was by far my favorite chapter of the book.Problems/Exercises:I only briefly skimmed over a few of the exercises and problems included in this book but they did help improve my understanding of the topics. According to the authors the provided practice problems are “easy” so if you want more of a challenge you will need to look elsewhere.Criticisms:In the middle chapters of the book, the authors use fewer real world examples and prose style writing. This is extremely unfortunate because, to someone unfamiliar with the field, it provided a hook to draw you into the more math heavy sections. Also, while the authors are very detailed and thorough in explaining different theories and types of models, they do not do a great job of listing the strengths and weaknesses of each. If I was required to make one of the models explained in this book, I probably could, but if I was asked to choose which model would be best for a given situation I would probably be unable to do so. They should have been clearer about what models are used in different situations and provided guidelines for selecting which model to use (beyond Occam’s razor). This would better connect the material to real world use and be more beneficial to the readers.Conclusion:Learning From Data provided a quick but thorough overview of modeling and machine learning. If you would like to learn more about the subject and have the required math background, it is a very good place to start. It will give you the background, main models, errors, and principles necessary for you to not only learn the language of the field but also critique and even create your own models. I highly recommend it.Score: 4.5/5"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Prof. Abu-Mostafa is an amazing teacher and I must recommend this book highly.This book is possibly the best ""short"" introduction to the subject. The authors really know how to communicate the _essentials_ of Machine Learning. You can always pick up a 1000+ page tome after reading this one.I would highly recommend reading this book in conjunction with Prof. Abu-Mostafa's video lectures on You Tube. The book comes to life after hearing his lectures. The complex subject almost seems simple (!) and I've spent hours totally spellbound at the sheer lucidity of his video lectures.The lectures and the book track each other quite well. Prof. Abu-Mostafa teaches SVMs and a few other topics in his lectures on You Tube but they are, unfortunately, not covered in the book. Perhaps a newer edition of the book would include them?I would also highly recommend his Learning from Data MOOC course -- check the website of the book for information on if/when it would be offered next."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good book. Written for the sophisticated undergraduate. Calculus, linear algebra, and knowledge of probability are assumed.The physical book only includes the first five chapters of the book, but as of now, there are four more chapters at the book's website. These chapters provide supplemental material including a chapter on support vector machines, a chapter on neural networks, and a chapter on clustering algorithms."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book helped me quite a lot when I was enrolled in Caltech's online course on machine learning taught by Prof. Yaser last summer (2012). It is more heavy in concepts than in practical examples, but shows clearly the ""boundaries"" and ""gotchas"" you have when doing general ML.Although scarce in numeric examples, it has many good advice spread around. The ML techniques which are very well explained in the book are those related with linear or linearized (through nonlinear transformations) models (linear regression and classification, perceptron, use of gradient in minimization,...), although in the Caltech's course Neural Network and SVM models and techniques have been very well presented.The models taught in the book serve as test beds for treating the perennial problems: when is learning possible? How to overcome data noise, sampling bias, overfitting and data snooping issues in practical situations? These fundamental concerns are transverse to all ML models and techniques. These are the matters where this book shines.The book is high-quality (nice paper and color pictures), and is sold at a very low price: it is a must-have for ML wizards :-) (and wannabees)."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pedro Domingos starts his popular book on machine learning with a breathless tour of everyday life in middle-class America.As you drive to work, check your stocks, book a flight, do a little shopping and use the Internet, you're continually interacting with (and being surveilled by) AI learning systems. They can do so much, yet as Amazon's recommendations system continually reminds us, they also fall so short.There are five main schools of thought in today's machine learning community,The symbolists have inverse deduction (I think this is abduction)the connectionists have backpropagationthe evolutionaries have genetic programmingthe Bayesians have probabilistic inferencethe analogizers have support vector machines.Pedro Domingos believes that what we really need is a single algorithm combining the key features of all of them. In the final part of his book he describes Markov logic networks, his own best candidate for the way forward.If I had to infer Pedro Domingos' personality type from reading his book (personality inference, he thinks, will become commonplace in future automated systems) I would guess ENTP. The books is optimistic, provocative, full of ideas, clever ... and sprawling, lacking conceptual coherence and depth.The experience of reading it is that of empty calories. Popular science books avoid the complex abstractions of the real science in favour of familiar (but underpowered and ultimately misleading) analogies. Domingos is not afraid to use technical labels - Bayesian inference, hidden Markov models - but he carefully avoids any technical depth in his explanations. Ultimately the reader who has not previously studied a topic will be no wiser, drowning in cotton wool.What is this machine learning all about? How can we understand it in a broader scientific framework? I was frustrated by being no clearer at the end of this book than at the beginning. Algorithms are not the stuff of science or explanation - they are realisation of relationships between inputs and outputs which need to be anchored in an underlying theory. The neuroscientist David Marr, namechecked in the book, was particularly insistent on separating these levels of description. Yet a theoretical framework for machine learning is conspicuously absent in Pedro Domingos' account; you never see the wood for the trees.I was glad I read it, if only for the identification of the 'five tribes' mentioned above and his hand-wavy overview of their approaches. But given his intended audience, the book would have been much improved if the author had simply included five 'Scientific American' level appendices explaining at a semi-technical level how the five approaches actually work; including some maths."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Das Buch ist sehr praktisch orientiert mit vielen Beispielen und Antworten auf gängige Fragen. Für den praktischen Einsatz von Machine Learning mittels Python ist es sehr hilfreich und deckt sowohl das klassische Machine Learning mit scikit-learn als auch Neuronale Netzwerke mit Tensorflow und vieles weitere ab. Das Buch ist vorallem zu empfehlen wenn man bereits Vorwissen zur Funktionsweise der Algorithmen hat, denn für Hintergrundwissen zu Algorithmen und Machine Learning im Allgemeinen sollte lieber ein anderes Buch genommen werden."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Un ouvrage excellent pour mieux comprendre et appliquer les différentes techniques sous Python. L'ouvrage présente l'évolution des techniques à partir des régressions (linéaires et logistiques) avec une gradation vraiment bien construite. On passe sans problème des régressions linéaires vers les SVM avec des explications sur les différences et l'apparition de l'impact des paramètres. Ensuite on comprend l'évolution des arbres de décisions vers les random forest .. et les techniques de Boosting comme un nouveau défi pour résoudre un problème rencontré. L'ouvrage détaille beaucoup les réseaux de neurones ... mais fait l'impasse sur les réseaux bayésiens ainsi que le traitement des données textuelles (c'est le seul défaut de cet ouvrage). Pour ma part j'y ai trouvé des explications sur l'utilisation des paramètres pour les outils qui utilisent Scikit Learn. L'ouvrage est facile à lire et permet de progresser.

At least from my last 5-6 books that I have read about ML/DL/TF, this was definitely the best one so far :)"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"El libro es bastante adecuado para empezar a estudiar los temas de Aprendizaje de Máquina. Los ejemplos son lo suficientemente claros y abarcan muchos temas al respecto.Como es costumbre, el libro llegó en perfectas condiciones y en el tiempo prometido.Dos comentarios finales:1) El libro asume que sabemos programar en python, y de ahí parte para usar Tensor Flow, y2) El libro está impreso a ""blanco y negro"" y eso dificulta estudiar las gráficas que muestra... Yo pensaría que la versión impresa debería ser impresa con colores.Por la falta de impresión a color le pongo 4 estrellas."

I just question his teaching skills regarding BEGINNERS.The info on this book is great. Definitely useful. The problem is that in order for you to use it in a productive way, you need to be very well educated on ML techniques.Part I is very good. Part II is very dificult. This book is definitely not good for beginners or even intermediate ML students (in my opinion).But I give it 3 stars anyway. The info is great. I just need to study it more."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"me gusta, el libro está muy bien y toca muchos aspectos de Deep learning con bastante profundidad, me hubiera gustado que hiciese una entrada más ""suave"" pero lo cierto es que enseguida se mete en profundidad en muchos conceptos que necesitan de estudio individual para poder asimilarlos bien. TensorFlow no es ""instalar y usar"", hay que tener un bagaje previo bastante grande para usarlo correctamente, no es como aprender de repente a programar en otro lenguaje, creo que las personas que realmente le sacan partido invierten el 100% de su jornada laboral en estos temas."

El material en la red que ofrece es excelente. Para quien no tuvo conocimiento previo de este tema, el autor explica con buen nivel de detalle cada cosa. No es material sencillo y el código que acompaña al libro se actualiza por lo que es indispensable leerlo con tu computadora a la mano."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is a wonderful introduction to Machine Learning, with easy to follow examples and great explanation of the concepts involved.It's divided into two parts, the first deals with ""classical"" machine learning using scikit-learn which is my favorite part of the book. The second part deals with (deep) neural networks using Tensorflow. It explains the concepts well, but I liked it a lot less than the first part. I read it cover to cover in the kindle version (very practical together with the web-based kindle app and the jupyter notebooks). I will also buy the printed version to keep for reference later on (too bad that Amazon doesn't offer a discount to people who wish to buy both versions).All in all very recommended!"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is by far one of the best books i have ever read. For many years i have struggled with abtuse books on algorithms, programming languages and mathematics. This book is unlike anything i have read before. For the last 20 years, I as a lay person, who has not taken any university classes in AI and programming have had problems  moving passed certain levels of complexity in my understanding. Simple things like decision tress and recursion had eluded me in the many books i read, seeming intangible in the areas where they would interface to the real world. Reading the explanations in this book i have finally got it. These authors through scenarios, explanations and code (replicated in many languages on the companion website) explain decision based structures and there use in agent design ,assuming very little along the way, outside of an elementary understanding of programming and logic, thus not losing me the reader. They gave me the building blocks and showed me how and why i would want to assemble them.The code in this book is both beautiful, elegant and succinct all at the same time. The hours of exploration and learning i got from these samples alone were worth the price of the book.If you are learning to program -- Read this book.If you interested in decision and value based reasoning -- Read this book.This is not a short book, but it is well worth the time investment. I plan on having it done within the year. I have learned so much about what i realize i knew so little of before, but I am so much more capable now than i ever was before, and that is because of this book."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am currently using this book for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) course at Duke University. I purchased the book because it was required for the course, and have been pleased with it thus far.The book is well written and very comprehensive. It does not go into great detail with the various topics in AI, but it does give a very thorough overview of methods being used. It appears to be very up-to-date with the subject matter. Also, it is not programming language specific, which was great for me because my java and C are a bit rusty.It is a bit pricey, but no more than other well written text books. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to get into or to teach a course in AI."

When I was in chapter 4 I started having difficulties to follow the book because I needed to have access to extra material which is not inside the book. So I sent an e-mail to the publisher who answered me very very quickly. Their attention with their clients really amazed me considering this pandemic times we are living. So I'm still loving this book and I hope you like it too. I think that it doesn't matter the carrier we're in, we will all have to deal with AI, so I think, the sooner we face it, the better."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good introduction to AI and how it works. Could use a bit more tutoring on Python programming.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book gives you a hands-on approach to learning by doing Python for Machine Learning. As opposed to many Machine learning books that dive deep into the theory without any practical explanation, this book explained all the ML approaches using Python and Visualization.It gives you a great deal of context and useful tools for solving all kinds of Machine Learning problems. In the deep learning chapter, you will get an excellent overview and the background to understand when and where to apply the various techniques starting from ANN, CNN to RNN. LSTM is also. Very well explained with a very excellent example.The book is code-focused, so you'll have the option to run working code on real problems throughout the book. The data and codes are available on the author Github rep.Most essential for me too, he focuses on explanation over equations that are rampant in other ML books. Unlike other books, the author is skipped the hard-part of breaking complicated concepts down into chunks that can be consumed by a competent beginner.Moreover, this author does so without dumbing down the content. That's the mark of someone who well understands both the content and the audience.The publication quality of the print edition is excellent. If you need the colour version, don't hesitate to get the pdf version available for download. The Publisher chose to produce all these books in black and white to reduce the acquisition cost for beginners. It still offered us the colour version for free in pdf format. I think this is a good thing"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the writing in this book. It takes you through step by step and has exercises that work, until chapter 4. In Chapter 4 they want you to use a dataset, and they don't tell you where it comes from! It's supposed to be on their GitHub site, but it isn't.They also state upfront that, because of printing costs, the book is in black and white, but a .pdf file can be found on their site. Trying to access that site will send you to someone who is trying to sell you a website.Update: I contacted them through email and they replied giving me the GitHub address where I can find the .pdf of the book! Thanks Customer Support!Update: So, I've got the .pdf of the book, and I've got the downloads for the case studies. These are at different GitHub repositories, with no logical link between them. So for the new purchaser you will still have to write to customer support and the 2nd repository from them. I could give it here, but then there'd be no reason for you to buy the book, and they'd probably sue me. Last, there's no GitHub repository for the data sets used in the first few chapters. You'll have to search for them online. Good Luck!Update: Thanks again to Customer support. They figured out that their main link in the book was broken and fixed it. All is good."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the book at the full price early on. The book has been a disappointment in delivering against what it promised.Biggest negative is the author's constant rant against fellow practitioners, econometric studies, p-values etc. These make up easily half of the book. Author has a very high ego. The constant need to batter some fellow practitioners and others working on the subject leaves a bad taste.The book has some useful ideas for which the slides in pdf format from the author's taught course are enough. More than 80-90% content in the book is nto usefulHere are the useful ideas that are briefly touched upon1. Nowcasting vs. Forecasting. Using data from Billion Price Index for inflation and other leading indicators for industrial production could be useful. Author provides a good idea that once cause->effect is identified, one can trade on the same by replacing the actual data with the nowcasted data2. One very useful idea in the book is the triple barrier method & meta-modeling (latter poorly explained). This is labelling as +1, 0 and -1 based on if the target was hit, max holding periods reached and stoploss breached respectively. A secondary model maybe built for the size by labeling the outcomes as a gain or as a loss.Author provides an interesting formula for bet size based on the strength of the signalWhile doing so, author suggests embargoing data if there are shared label periods between train/test or if train immediately follows test using a thumb rule of 1% of the data3. Rarely nowadays anyone removes stationarity in time series. Author suggests fractional differentiation as a useful tool4. Author suggests using values from cusum tests, explosiveness tests, entropy features and microstructural features for ML modelingAuthor explains how leakage can appear in back-testing through survivorship bias, look-ahead bias, outliers, transaction costs, not taking borrowing costs into account etc. These are all very well known to ML practitioners in finance. To avoid choosing the experiment with the highest Sharpe Ratio that may just be a false +ve, he suggests clustering usage and reporting mean/standard deviation across theseOverall, other than above, it is  a set of rants of the author, his ego and lot of stuff on ML that all know"
,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okie to read ... But examples are not clear enough
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Often books on quantitative finance are too fixated on theoretical know-hows or are completely from a practitioners perspective with disregard to the theoretical foundations. Advances in Financial Machine learning does a great job in presenting a balanced view on the aspects to keep in mind while using Machine Learning in finance. A theoretical model together with machine learning algorithm might look good, but how do you test it with real data sets without  falling into the common traps is something quite necessary to know. The book does a great job in making us realise that. Would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in applying machine learning in finance."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is the best of the best book on the trending topic of financial machine learning. It has been properly designed for anyone to understand it from root to tip of the topic.

Nothing more though that I wouldn't find online.Additionally, it is full of typos, and I spotted some important things that seem wrong to me (for example, the error term in model reflect the variance that can be explain, and I guess the author means that cannot be explained). Such errors shouldn't be there. It is to me waste of money (almost 50 euros) for a book where the author did not even bother revising it properly."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,very helpful book saved hours searching through documentation
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It was a tough decision to buy this book since I have read most of the author’s previous papers and I had formed a fairly negative impression of his work -I have also felt he just doesn’t know the literature. I am afraid the book just cofirms this view, much of this book is ad hoc largely irrelevant pretentious rubbish and it is thus second rate and a waste of money. Over many years I have come away from reading his work wondering what have I learnt? What problem has he solved? The answer is generally nothing. He just doesn’t ask the right questions and never really gets close to using the correct and existing theory which is readily available in either the statistical or ML literature. Also as other reviewers have said this quite simply is not a book about machine learning at all - just a collection of various notes and code and virtually all of the material is already available on SSRN. So against my better judgement I bought the book and wasted my money except it confirmed my view this guy simply doesn’t fundamentally know what the real issues are in Finance or Machine Learning. For the serious science of machine learning look elsewhere- Efron and Hastie’s book for instance or anything Trevor Hastie has written with Rob Tibshirani."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is great, but goodness is the author pretentious. This book is an apology of his own work with countless self-quotes. Before stating anything true, he has to say how everybody else is wrong. It makes an otherwise good book tedious to read."

I would like to have more details and make the learning scale more smoothly.Will update after I went through the whole book. Maybe I would buy some other ML book first then come back to it."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"A little too much Linear Algebra for my taste.  I'm skipping the linear algebra bits and moving on to the coding.  The use of libraries in the coding examples is lightly explained.  Other than that This book does seem to explain things ok but the approach is more from an academic than from a normal human being - reminds me of my college days where the ""doctor"" wants to make sure you know they are ""very smart"".  If you looooove linear algebra and can't stand simple human explanations then this is your book.  I'd recommend something a little more basic for those of us who are very smart but haven't learned the linear algebra language.  There are many other books that are able to explain the algorithms and other processes without speaking linear algebra."

I find myself reaching for this book more than my more traditionally academic books when working with others. The people I work with want to understand how the techniques work in general; they aren't after impressive equations or technical language, impressive though it might sound. The more conversational tone is accessible and ease to dip back into for a reminder when used as a high level reference text.Overall, an especially good library addition for people working with non-stats people."

Non per nulla l'ho usato come libro di supporto al famoso ""mining of massive datasets""( anche se, ad esempio, a differenza di quest'ultimo, la parte di machine Learning ovvero SVM è molto più chiara qui).

The material is presented in a very lucid manner, both in the book as well as in the course, with enough illustrations, examples and work-outs to make the subject and techniques settle down well to become a habit.Highly recommended for anyone with aspiration to be machine-learning expert."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are a beginner in ML, buy this book! If you have a quantitative background and are planning to dabble in ML, buy the book. I fall in the latter category, but am a ML novice; and recently, started to learn through ML books and online resources. Until recently, I couldn't quite build a mental framework within which to view and place ML approaches, justifications, performance, etc., nor could I quite contrast ML against ""classical"" data analysis approaches (oh well, why can't I just fit the data, and carefully deal with interpolation/extrapolation matters, etc. etc.). As I explored the subject through other texts & online material, largely, it seemed a choppy sea of techniques flotsam, a confusing landscape of differing terminology, and, I couldn't quite ""put my finger"" on the subject, nor could I conceive a framework to view the ML approach. And then, fortuitously, I came across this book! I believe it provides a much needed principled approach to the subject, introducing intuitive terminology, suggesting a line of thought through sequencing of material, and systematically covering the core essentials; all this, in a manner that nicely balances readability & mathematical rigor.  After a quick read, I do have a mental framework to place ML developments (and no doubt, it will get tweaked & refined over time). Since I'm a novice, I risk being shot down for making such bold statements, however, I suspect I'm probably not far from the truth in saying that there is a need for such an expository text. I wouldn't be surprised if there aren't a ton of other ML beginners who are as appreciative of this book, as I am. Thank you for this wonderful book!Incidentally, the authors also provide a free online course covering the material in the text, and a few additional topics covering the basics of neural networks, SVMs, kernel methods, and the use of RBFs. The book, along with these additional online video lectures, are a near perfect mix to get the beginner going!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent book, and even moreso because of the accompanying video lectures. Highly recommended.Although the primary algorithmic coverage only includes linear models and neural nets (neural nets are covered in the video lectures, not the book), this book provides an excellent peas-and-carrots overview of data mining practices and the theory of learning. If you're like me, you've avoided the theory and only wanted to dig into specific algorithms, but at some point you need the theory and the best-practices. This book provides these, and it is very accessible. The online lectures are excellent as well, and are nice when you just want to review. The back-propagation video lecture was by far the simplest anywhere.Grab this book over summer or for a flight, learn one or two linear models, then learn and implement back-propagation. Whether you're a curious undergrad or you already have machine learning experience, there's something for everyone."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"When I opened it, the corner was a bit folded and the way that the book was printed looks like it wasn't cut properly. Some of the pages are uncut, which means I have to trim these in order to read it. I must've gotten a bad copy- disappointing, as I was more interested in reviewing the content of the book than it's print condition."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book provides information on machine learning topics in a very understandable manner. it really helped me to understand the underlying concepts but also some of the math behind and the implementation in python. Really liked the tasks at the end of each chapter! However, what really bugged me: I bought the old version for the same price as of the new version. I just did not know that there is a newer version. This is not the fault of the author so the stars will still be 5 stars."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With an interest to understand what machine learning is, it appears quite intimidate and hard to find a book that is easy to read and without the heavy math (I am at an age of close to retirement, so my math in calculus is clearly rusty). This book just the right choice as it is easy to read without the burden of equations after equations, and has provided a roadmap leading to all relevant topics with great length of details that are clearly articulated. I particular like chapter 2, which gives an idea of what an end-to-end project is like, right at the early part of the book. The examples included of how to use the Scikit-Learn library really pump me into action."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is a introduction to both Machine Learning (Chapter 1) and Deep Learning (Chapter 2). Note: ML is about algorithms, DL about Neural Networks.The main principles are pretty well explained and there are a lot of Hyperlinks provided for further study. Although it is on a scientific level, It is relatively easy to understand."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit:you're better off reading the author slides for his course in Cornell about the same topic (slides are on SSRN) if you'd like to learn this stuff. Better yet, try rewriting the code in the book in a clear way and use real data for your experiments.My gripe with De Prado is that, while he may be a genial scientist (?) and/or portfolio manager, the book seemed to have been written in a rushed and/or deliberately obscure way. If you have eons to spare, you will learn some useful tricks here. I'd love a follow-up version of this book where:1. the code is up-to-date2. the code can be found on a repository (e.g. Github/Colab)3. more real-life examples (perhaps showing the performance of funds using similar strategies)Academically this is an interesting text, but I feel like the literature is a bit misguiding. To be fair, true alpha is never to be found on a textbook, but I'd love to see less equations and more explanations. Perhaps that's a project for the reader...Edit: (after 3 months studying and replicating the code in the book)Various people like Ernie Chan, and Hudson&Thames have built businesses out of this book. So, for the experienced quant, some proverbial light bulbs may switch on.While I like a lot of Lopez-Prado's (LP) thinking, this book is disappointing. Too many self-references, very unclear Python code, and poor explanation of the main ideas. As a pedagogical experiment it failed fast. Perhaps it serves well as a guide book to the author published paper -- but for that I think his website and slides is a MUCH better option.Suggestion:- hire a better editor: important concepts and formulas and code need to be highlighted- consult with ML practitioners on coding best practices, and provide code support to the book. Otherwise don't bother adding code samples to the book at all. I recommend the reader to try to reimplement LP's code themselves to only find themselves scratching their heads not long after- calling a book advanced is not an excuse for making it readable- it lacks reproducible numerical examples and colour schemesBought it and I'm returning it to Amazon. Not a good book on HTF, nor ML."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say? I pre-ordered this book last year and had high hopes. The books assumes you are expert both in machine learning, python and also all the complex financial models. In reality very few people are expert in both fields. The author recommends to attend one of his seminars and ask him if you don't understand something :)-really disappointed. I am a technical guy working at an asset management firm but could not understand a thing from this book"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did already a lot of research about machine learning in trading myself, before the book was published. When reading the book, a few items confirmed my own experience/lessons learned and a few other topics were real eye openers. Marcos not only explains in his book what are the things that work but also why they work. I had to read a few topics twice to fully absorb it. The book is for an 'advanced' audience and strongly recommended if you are serious about the topic."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent book. Compact and conscise. The author is very knowledgable and does a very good at explaining many advanced subjects. The book is addressed to practiotioners and includes (compact) python code snippets for most algorithms and methods discussed. Although it covers a lot of material, the author managed to concentrate on the essentials, which resulted in a good of very reasonable size. It is mostly a self-sufficient book (assuming the reader has some background in mathematics and finance) and the author provides plenty of references for anyone wishing to explore a subject in more detail. Excellent!"

There are loads of insight information/ ideas which are totally useful for improving my trading system. This book is definitely highly recommended!!!
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unfortunately the ego of the author is so large there is no room left in the book to include any useful information. He also makes a big deal of concepts that he has simply failed to grasp that are well understood by more modest practitioners.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A well written book by a very knowledgable author. I'm a ML Engineer but my finance background is limited. The author takes the time to explain everything in great detail from code to algorithms to even setting up your own teams. The python snippets are useful to understand whats under the hood. It covers a lot of material so come prepared.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This 4 book set focuses on Python programming.  The 1st book details how easy Python is to learn and use as opposed to something C++.  I liked that terms are explained in great detail and there are tons of examples.  Every step has a screen grab to make sure you are following along in the learning process.  Book 2 focuses on data analysis with Python.  So anyone in the business world with definitely benefit from this book.  The ways Python can streamline and speed up data analysis is examined.  Again there are tons of examples and it is easy to follow.  Book 3 focuses on Machine Learning.  Python seems to be the future of AI, and one who hopes to build a future in that arena needs a strong foundation in Python.  The author dispels myths and fears that are common when AI is discussed especially that it will take people's jobs.  Instead the author believes AI will create just as many jobs, just in different areas.  Book 4's subject is data science.  And the benefits Python can bring to that area of business and math.  Again, this book is loaded with examples and every formula and chart is explained so well.  I was not lost at all.  The autjor comes across as a highly knowledgeable expert imparting credible info.  I recommend this to anyone wanting to explore Python more."

If your job entails compiling data for insight adding Python language is supposed to enhance  your  data. The good news is a great deal of the information is presented with exercises and examples for better visualization. Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Data Science. Data Science is very technical and there's a lot of language. Machine Learning is a way label and analyze large bits of data quicker. There's a ton of information,  which I was surprisingly able to understand. I a m not in school or need to know Python for my job. I just want to learn something new.

Francois has not only provided easy to understand examples using Keras(which makes you get running code in no time), he has also made sure that the person studying it understands the tricks to be used to become close to pro in the field. Data augmentation was a very good idea. It also helps to see and appreciate such tools as you see clear examples of how the idea is helping the model. Also cleared was my doubt that DNN is a not blackbox and can actually be reasoned about."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is written by someone who clearly has two major abilities: they have a love of the subject, and they communicate it clearly.The book contains real examples of Python/Keras code to do deep learning on standard data sets. Some knowledge of Python is required, but I think that any competent programmer can get this as they go along. I certainly improved my Python while working through the examples.The author makes clear their belief that a Linux system is required to do the examples in the book. This is the author's only major mistake. I have tried the examples under Windows 10/Anaconda 3 and they simply work. Perhaps the GPU based examples work better under Linux - I didn't try these.After finishing the book, the reader will be well placed to know the basics of deep learning, and to take the subject further."

Instead of lengthy and go-around explanations, author goes rather quickly to what is learning, how to measure the complexity and how to use it. Each chapter is rather short but tightly packed with information. Also, each chapter has a generous number of practical examples to work on. A reader is expected at least to read them as the assignments are often continuing on some subject or idea laid out in the chapter.I would not suggest this book to a beginner. An advanced undergraduate could grasp it."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Learning from Data is an excellent book for Machine Learning. This book along with the Caltech lectures by Prof. Abu-Mostafa (available on youtube) holds the potential to build a solid foundation in machine learning.Highly recommended.
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As a companion to the CalTech MOOC class on Machine Learning, it was helpful. It's definitely a more theoretical book than others on machine learning and pretty much geared specifically to teaching an intro class.  We were given 'e-chapters' as supplements as the book is pretty light on methods other than linear and logistic regression. My guess is that subsequent editions of the book will be 'fleshed' out with these additional materials. Once the next edition comes out, hopefully with the chapters on SVM, neural networks, and other methods, this will be a much more comprehensive book.Outside of the context of a classroom or online course, the book as it is might not be what you're looking for. (Unless you want to explore the theoretical underpinnings of ML.)"

I've maybe spent 8 hours tops reading it whenever time has allowed.Within a day or two of cracking it open, a whole section of pages fell out of their stitching. Nearly all of chapter 2 fell apart. I didn't both returning it because I wanted to read it, but now I find it super annoying.If you want good content, the book is worth picking up. Be aware that the book might fall apart."

El autor explica cómo utilizar Tensorflow para problemas pequeños de regresión y después para crear redes neuronales. Además de cubrir deep learning, abarca muchos otros temas. Es uno de los pocos libros (que siguen un enfoque práctico) que contienen fórmulas con el texto. Ampliamente recomendado."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent book with a lot easy to read theory with good examples. Examples with TF a little bit too easy but it is OK as book is for people who just starting this subject.Must have for studying ML.

,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great book with a lot of practical tips. I found the questions at the end of every chapter quite a good way to think about improvements to the algorithms. It would be super useful if there were a solution manual for the questions.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Eine durchwegs interessante Abhandlung über den Prozess von den Rohdaten bis zur fertigen Handelsstrategie mit starkem Fokus auf die Fallstricke in den entsprechenen Bereichen.Als Berufseinsteiger mit geringen Programmierkenntnissen durchaus interessant aber gleichzeitig herausfordernd zu lesen. Als Zielgruppe werden erfahrene Programmierer und Entwickler sowie Finanzexperten genannt. In jedem Fall haben mir die Ausführungen von Lopez de Prado geholfen, verschiedene state of the art Machine Learning Anwendungen in der Finanzwirtschaft zu verstehen. Durch diesen Einblick in die weitläufigen Einsatzgebiete des Machine Learning bin ich nun sehr motiviert, mehr über diesen Bereich zu lernen und mein Wissen diesbezüglich auszubauen.Aus meiner Sicht (Berufseinsteiger Finanzbereich) durchaus eine Empfehlung. Interesse am Fach vorausgesetzt, gibt das Buch einen sehr guten Überblick über die Einsatzbereiche von Machine Learning und konnte in meinem Fall das Interesse an einer Vertiefung im Feld des Machine Learning wecken."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,The author doesn't provide sufficient details to implement a system similar to what he is using. Very high level review of a very particular implementation. You can only understand the subject if you already know it. The real benefit of reading this book is to find out where an average financial enterprise is in terms of adopting the AI.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Per chi si interessa di machine learning e algoritmi per la finanza è davvero un libro ottimale. Insegna molte cose utili dal pretrattamento dei dati all'analisi dei risultati per evitare di finire in algoritmi che non funzionano. Insegna a ragionare su misure di riferimento diverse dalle classiche candele dell'analisi tecnica in modo da aver dati molto più digeribili per algoritmi di automazione.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book that I am currently reading is the best to learn about machine learning in the financial industry. However in order to understand the book, you need at least an intermediate level in machine learning, computational skills, and knowledge in time series. If you read the whole book, you will find that the author focuses on the following topics:How to deal with raw financial dataThe importance of backtestingFeature EngineeringAs long as you have fundamental knowledge in data science, you should know the importance of the three points stated above. Fortunately, this books gives a great guide that shows us how to solve these problems. Although the solutions provided in the books can be disproved, it does not matter as you cannot find another author that is willing to share his ideas to the industry."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The best indicator that a teacher understands a complex topic is his/her ability to explain it in simple terms. Unfortunately, this book seems to make a rather difficult topic even more complex. I even dare to doubt that the author understands himself what he writes about.There is better material about finance and AI on the market for much less money. Most likely - and for obvious reasons - there will be no useful literature about successful attempts to model the share market."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Contrary to many applied machine learning books, it does not bore the reader with lengthy introductory chapters of what e.g. neural networks or support vector machines are. Instead, it goes straight to the root of a specific problem - many times one the reader was not aware existed - and works through it in a well-balanced mix between theory/coding and wisdom gained from the author's work in the financial industry. This is not an introductory book - the reader should be familiar with elementary machine learning, statistics, Python - it is however, a book that brings actual content."

If not the best.It doesn't go full tilt into all the mathematics behind it - something I appreciate - but it sure gives you enough to get you started as well as a good way towards the more advanced subjects in this field. If you want all the formulas and algorithms behind this - there are better books but if you want to hit the ground running this is the book for you.I don't think I can recommend this book highly enough."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a hands on practical book for people who want to get into deep learning quickly. It requires knowledge of python but almost no knowledge of AI, explaining for instance the basic concepts of annotation, labelled instances and the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.It starts with a series on simple practical examples which the reader can easily reproduce and explore alone. The explanations are readable and understandable away from a computer (I read much of it on holiday).  It then goes into detail of the two most advanced applications of deep learning - image processing and text processing.The notation throughout is python rather than formal mathematical notation. If you like reading code but don't like reading matrix equations, this will be ideal. The one possible shortcoming is that it veers heavily to the practical side and isn't concerned with the theory.  Thus it doesn't explain how backprop works or even give you the equations, merely noting that most packages automate them so you might as well not waste your time and get on with learning how to do it.  This is perhaps a wise approach since Hinton's excellent coursera lectures are freely available and are both accessible and rigorous."

If you are not familiar with DL at all read blogs/articles first. If you are then it will be easy to follow.However, if you want to follow along with some very simple exercises don't expect to get the same results (i.e. loss or accuracy as francis attains with the provided code). In other words he's half assed this, if he's reading this get it sorted asap mate! (very poor and frustrating for the standard at which he is working at). All of the code should be replicable within ~1% here and there as far as i'm concerned.For practical hands on experience get onto a udemy course for £15.For a quick and concise guide its okay as well - not read other books as of yet which are as accessible without heavy math and programming so from this point its well done"

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The author says his intention was to cover the fundamentals of deep learning, Keras usage patterns, and best practices. If you know Keras then I guess you'll learn a great deal about best practice but the book does not cover Keras in any detail and if you don't know it then best practice isn't really relevant to you."

However the international edition (paperback, anyway) is very poorly bound. Many of the pages fall out simply by turning them.

The content is extremely dry, uses little real world examples to help draw parallels, and assumes a lot of the reader with the excessive notation.

If, however, you are new to data mining and do not already have a statistical background then this book is absolutely awful. The writing is overly repetitive, as if the authors wrote separately and didn't compare what they had written before just merging it all together, and there aren't nearly enough visuals.

Granted, I have a great professor, but the textbook deserves a lot of credit too. It explains all of the steps in the Knowledge Discovery/Data Mining process and some key techniques in a way that left me feeling confident and wanting to learn more.The author(s) did a great job of explaining complex topics. It's a textbook, so there's a good combination of both theory and math. I like the way that the book uses one company as the focus of examples for the entire book. It's creates continuity. I will admit that there are a few points where the author assumes that the reader knows a math concept and doesn't explain it, but overall, if you have at least an introductory level knowledge of statistics, you'll be fine. ."

Very well written, very clearly explained facts and methods, and the authors know exactly how to make the heavy-duty stuffs interesting and clearly explainable in class-room setting. I enjoyed reading every page of this book. Not to forget that this book is also accompanied by 'the best set of video lectures' on machine learning taught by Prof. Abu-Mostafe at Caltech, available online, with a wide range of discussions on the topics, problems and solutions.One may think that this book is a bit thin in terms of its contents. To me it is important to know why I am doing certain things rather than to know what are the possible things I can do. This book is along the line of why, where and of course how we use machine learning, and provides tools whenever necessary, without sacrificing mathematical rigor. It is meant to be a short course as the title says. Even if you have read other books on machine learning, reading this book is worthwhile; at the least, it will revitalize your interest in the subject and give you a clear(er) perspective. Therefore, I feel that this book is a must-read for everyone. Happy reading!"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Physics Professor Richard Feynman’s commencement address at Caltech in 1974:“But this long history of learning how to not fool ourselves – of having utter scientific integrity – is, I’m sorry to say, something that we haven’t specifically included in any particular course that I know of.  We just hope you’ve caught on by osmosis. The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that.  After you’ve not fooled yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists.  You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.”This is one of the main endeavours that Marcos Lopez de Prado’s (MLdP henceforth) aims to achieve with the dissemination of his research through “Advances in Financial Machine Learning”. With more than two decades of experience in finance, both as a practitioner and as an academic researcher, MLdP’s book is a gift. Unique on its own. A blend of the practical, the theoretical, the hypothetical but verifiable, and the abstract, but always with the feet firmly on the ground, always atuned with and subservient to reality.I started to follow MLdP’s work when studying flash crashes, intraday market patterns and other high frequency topics. Ever since, the author’s diverse practice and research has contributed to make Finance more rigorous, more evidence-based, less susceptible of ‘false discoveries’. MLdP’s practice and research has spanned a diverse range of areas (e.g. liquidity, intraday price discovery and market microstructure, portfolio/asset allocation, HF strategies, correlation/cointegration, risk management, backtesting …).As an engineer and economist, I started to approach financial markets almost a couple of decades ago from an eminently fundamental, theory-based, and macro-economic perspective, expressing tradeable views through all kind of asset classes and financial instruments. From the very beginning I felt the tension between the widely accepted/taught financial models in academia –– The Black Scholes Model, The Efficient Market Hypothesis, the Capital Asset Pricing Model, Factor-based Investing … –– and professional practice, while not sure how best to introduce ‘my intuition’ around markets; trends and positioning. Over the years, I’ve tried adding tools to my arsenal (a combination of self-learning, ‘on the desk’, as well as a couple of MSc’s degrees), such as modern econometrics, Behavioural Economics/Finance, Chaos Theory, and, more recently, Machine Learning techniques.MLdP’s book (and work) is a further advancement and contribution to make Finance more rigorous, closer to reality, a field that should take as much as possible the best traits and practices from Science and the scientific method, becoming a Pseudoscience. As in MLdP’s paper “Finance as an Industrial Science” it’s stated:“[f]inance cannot become a rigorous science (in the Popperian or Lakatosian sense), however it can still operate as an “industrial science”. This article describes the scientific method by which industrial finance discovers through experimentation, and avoids false discoveries.”No fundamental laws are advocated. No models are proposed for trading/investing. No algorithmic trading strategies. No dogmas. Instead, a transparent and verifiable set of approaches and paradigms, that will allow the reader-practitioner to increase the robustness and reliability of whatever forms of interaction have with financial markets: portfolio/asset allocation, trading strategies, risk measurement …This book elicited on me similar feelings and responses as when reading other career-changing/awakening books devoted to less conventional approaches such as Multifractal Geometry and Chaos Theory, Genetic Algorithms, Quantum Finance or Machine Learning, to try to better understand and model markets.*** Behavioural Finance, Predictions and Storytelling ***Economics Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman (author of the popular “Thinking, Fast and Slow”) has cautioned against future prediction, overconfidence, explaining why investors and entrepreneurs should rely on data to predict outcomes, not on their intuition. Such claims and advice are grounded on his research that showed the lapses in human judgement when making economic decisions.When reading MLdP’s analogy between- the ‘over-the-ground’ gold extraction at the time when the New Continent was discovered more than five hundred years ago (“visible and over ground gold made their way from the Americas into Spain and Europe” (MLDP 2018, p.6)) and the ‘under-the-ground’ gold, the latter requiring  mining technology in order to be located and extracted while accounting for the vast majority of gold on planet Earth, on the one hand, with- the ‘macro’ versus ‘microscopic‘ alpha (the former able to be identified by the savvy value-fundamental investor and/or through the old-school classical econometric and statistical models, while the latter mainly discoverable to the kind of the model-free ML approaches), on the other hand, it led me to establish a connection with Behavioural Finance’s (a subset of Behavioural Economics) main lessons and warnings, while endorsing ML techniques to uncover such dynamics.“Just like with gold, microscopic alpha doesn’t mean smaller overall profits. Microscopic alpha today is much more abundant than macroscopic alpha has ever been in history. There’s a lot of money to be made, but you will need to use heavy ML tools” (MLdP 2018, p.6)***  “Advances in Financial Machine Learning” - Hidden Gems ***MLdP’s book is full of treasures. But first, something to be thankful for are the Bibliography and Reference sections at the end of every chapter, which allows for a deeper and complementary learning of the issue/topic of interest. Same goes for the introductory Motivation sections, serving as the Abstract section in a typical Journal technical paper, as well as for the numerous Python codes throughout the book.Among the numerous treasures in the book that will prompt the reader to ponder about pre-existing beliefs and assumptions, as well as expanding and enrichening his perspectives, are:- ‘Meta-Labelling’ and the accompanying reflexions on the (hedge fund) ‘Quantamental Way’ (Chapter 3)- The ‘Stationary vs Memory Dilemma’ (Chapter 5), presenting a novel fractional-differentiated approach to make non-stationary time series stationary, balancing the trade-off between stationary (needed for ML performance) and memory retention (needed for good predictive power)- The ‘Ensemble Approach’ and the ‘Three Sources of Errors’ (Chapter 6)- The ‘Purging-Embargo’ approach (Chapter 7), aimed at reducing the likelihood that the popular k-fold Cross Validation method fails in model development applications- ‘Feature Importance’ (Chapter 8), which introduces us to the author’s ‘First Law of Backtesting’: “Backtesting is not a research tool. Feature importance is”- ‘Trading Rules’ (Chapter 13) and the characterization of the underlying price-generating stochastic process by using historical time series, minimizing the risk of ‘backtest overfitting’- Proof this is a book written by (and for) a practitioner is illustrated in Chapter 14, without which, the previous three chapters containing a trio of ‘Back Testing Paradigms’ would have been rendered less valuable and trustworthy, as we want to assess and compare the backtests of investment strategies in a rigorous and robust manner. Chapter 14 introduces numerous backtesting metrics, aimed at measuring different features: noteworthy, the risk-adjusted performance metrics in section ‘Efficiency’, which captures the essence of MLdP’s papers on the Probabilistic and Deflated Sharpe Ratio. It’s astonishing that since the standard Sharpe Ratio was introduced by William Sharpe back in the mid-60s, some of its various shortcomings have not been addressed earlier. This chapter also introduces us to MLdP’s ‘Third Law of Backtesting’.- “Strategy risk is not the risk of the underlying portfolio […] Strategy risk is the risk that the investment strategy will fail to succeed over time” (MLdP 2018, p.217). MLdP’s ‘Strategy Probability of Failure’ algorithm in Chapter 15 adds to the investment professional arsenal of tools to monitor and assess ‘risk’, not only ‘portfolio risk’- Much has been written, and alternative approaches been suggested, on the shortcomings of Markowitz’s (correlation-based) expected return-variance portfolio construction paradigm, but I wonder how many non-quadratic optimizers (like Markowitz’s one) the reader has encountered in his professional career. Graph Theory coupled with ML are behind the novel ‘Hierarchical Risk Parity’ (HRP) method presented in Chapter 16, which doesn’t require to invert any covariance matrix. Applications beyond portfolio construction are suggested, as well as an advancement to Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates “The All Weather Story” Risk Parity paradigm. On random data, the HRP allocation is compared with the min-variance Markowitz’s allocation and a Risk Parity traditional allocation, resulting in an interesting balanced portfolio, seemingly well-position to weather systematic and idiosyncratic shocks (for which the Markowitz’s and Risk Parity portfolios are better/worst placed, respectively).- From acclaimed information theorist Claude Shannon, MLdP suggest potential applications of the ‘Entropy’ to be estimated from financial price series. Chapter 18 feels like the start to a fruitful empirical research stream, with various applications such as trading strategies development or portfolio construction.- Being one of the longest chapters (16-page long), Chapter 19 on ‘Market Microstructure’ offers a succinct insight into the extensive and productive author’s work on these matters*** Summary and Conclusion ***This is not a typical book on Machine Learning, nor the typical book on Investing, Trading Strategies, Portfolio Construction, Asset Allocation, or Risk Management. It’s a book on the application of ML on Financial matters and intricacies.It’s a book that will help to debunk some of the recent myths around Financial ML, and to identify true applications where a wise deployment of ML technology will result in a competitive advantage.It’s a book for the various stages of the financial research laboratory model (the ‘Meta-Strategy’ paradigm), like a BMW car factory) that successful quant firms seem to be implementing:“[A]mateurs develop individual strategies […] [P]rofessionals develop methods to produce strategies […] Your goal is to run a research lab like a factory, where true discoveries are not born out of inspiration, but out of methodic hard work” (MLdP 2018, p.11)“Advances in Financial Machine Learning” succeeds in fulfilling the author’s three motivation to write it, namely- To cross the divide between academia and the financial industry- To upgrade the role of Finance in society- To explain the nuances, complexities and challenges when deploying ML techniques in Investing: “[b]eating the wisdom of the crowds is harder than recognizing faces or driving cars”"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t consider myself as a religious person, but man, this book is the Bible. I love how the author with all of his working experience manages to provide a book that actually works for engineering professionals besides of just writing up 500 pages of math definitions . I’m an engineer, show me how I should build things!. Amazing book, hats off to the author."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book opens your eyes over the world of algoritmic trading. I'm giving a course of trading and it gives another point of view. I've found very interesting the approach using machine learning in a different way, threading very carefully to prevent errors that are usual, and others that are not as easy to spot when using statistics for this type of problems. Highly recommended lecture but it's a little dense, so you will be looping over the same chapter and when you break the loop, you can find some insight in after chapters."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a standard for AI courses so, quite possibly, if you're looking at this is because you have to buy it. Good exposition in some areas, but there are just not enough examples available for some of the mathematical techniques, and I really think students need to see a few examples before they can really be confident. Of course, a lot of this is space constraints, but better online support might help there, and if you're teaching, make sure to provide a few examples - doing the same problem over and over again to see if they 'get it' leads to lots of students who think they can solve problems they really can't."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,The book is too verbose in some chapters and most of the examples are either too simple or are without  explanations. It seems that the chapters lack an overall tone to them. Perhaps this is due to the fact that there are two authors.

For a graduating Computer Science, I felt that it presented many examples and algorithms in a simple easy to understand way with great real world applications.My only complaint with this book is that a lot of the pseudocode is hard to follow and implements a lot of algorithms without any explanation.

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The content of the book seems pretty good.  I have only got up to about chapter four so far and it's easy to read and introduces material in a reasonably gentle manner.  The three stars are due to the fact that I am using the electronic version, on a kindle app on an Android tablet, and it has some issues.  It is mostly OK but suffers because quite a lot of the technical material is scanned rather than true font or vector which means that if you zoom in, the surrounding text gets bigger but the figures, formula and diagrams often don't.  This is particularly troublesome for mathematical formulas which are sometimes scanned at quiet low resolution and very difficult to decipher, not great when they are already quite complex to understand.It's usable though, much more convenient in electronic form and I've saved myself about $50 by renting the book on Amazon for four months compared to buying it at the Uni bookshop."

I haven't read the first two editions so i cannot judge if there is a lot of new stuff in this 3th edition, but i feel like i am able to make an expert system myself, having read the book.  Not for the layman though.  You need to have an engineer's or mathematical mind to grasp everything.  The book really covers everything from the neat's point of view.  In the heart, i am a scruffy but what this book has taught me, can certainly do no harm as it is a real overview of all the scientific techniques involved in making expert systems and other applications in AI."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I only purchased this book, because I wanted a reference book for Deep learning but could not wait for 2nd edition. Seeing the discounted price, I thougth I would go ahead with the purchase, and just buy 2nd edition again anyway later this year.This review is not about the content of the book, but of the book's quality. Specifically  I have a suspicion that the book I received was counterfeit. I say this for the following reasons:1) there is an insert that allows me to download the e-book for free from the publisher's website. However, the insert is littered with typos, of the automatic OCR scan-to-text type. Eg link is tink, etc.2) the binding looks a bit glue-gunned, especially to this insert3) the graphics look pixelated (especially the graphs), the print looks like it was done in economode, and the paper is recycled/grey looking.Therefore, be mindful of the purchase and gauge from the selling price. Remember that the MSRP is approx $65."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Die Erklärungen von Deep Learning und neuronalen Netzen usw. sind zunächst wirklich fantastisch, sehr einfach verständlich.Ab Kapitel 3 schien die Sorgfalt der Authoren allerdings sehr nachzulassen – die Codebeispiele sind hier teilweise fehlerhaft, und auch die Erläuterungen werden immer knapper und unverständlicher, mit etwas Zusatzaufwand kommt man aber schon durch.Es wirkt etwa so als ob man jemand, der diese Techniken praktisch einsetzt über die Schulter kuckt und schaut was der so macht, ohne alles gleich zu verstehen - in der Hoffnung dass man nach und nach schon selbst drauf kommt und sich das Bild zusammenfügen wird.Der Bereich Deep-Learning ist allerdings in sehr explosiver Entwicklung begriffen, und viele Anwendungen, die in den letzten Jahren Schlagzeilen gemacht haben, werden hier nur ""vorbereitet"".Die Lieferung war wie bei Amazon Büchern gewohnt extrem schnell.Das Buch hatte leider eine angestoßene Ecke und wirkt auch insgesamt eher wie ""mal schnell aus dem Kopierer gelassen"" - Ich finde das Schade, andere Verlage (bspw. No Starch Press) schaffen es trotz billigen Produktionskosten ganz schöne Bücher zu machen.Das größte Problem ist die fehlende Aktualität der Tools. Tensorflow hat sich in den letzten Jahren stark weiterentwickelt, und insbesondere die Vorschläge zur Einrichtung einer Ki-Workstation sind leider beinahe komplett unbrauchbar - deswegen lohnt es sich hier zumindest auf die im November erscheinende Neuauflage zu warten wenn man die Geduld dafür hat."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ho acquistato questo libro per studiare i fondamenti del Deep Learning e preparare la mia tesi di laurea. Non avrei potuto fare una scelta migliore. Il libro è una perfetta guida introduttiva al Deep Learning e permette a tutti di affrontare autonomamente questo complesso e affascinante argomento. La scrittura è scorrevole ed ogni concetto matematico viene spiegato tramite il suo equivalente in programmazione. Il libro è inoltre aggiornato con le ultime scoperte nel campo (GAN, LSTM, ...). Richiede una conoscenza media di Python. Consigliato dunque a tutti quelli che, come me, vogliono imparare le basi del Deep Learning e, nel mentre, applicare i concetti imparati. Per poi approfondire con libri più specifici e ricchi a livello matematico."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent book to get a quick start on deep learning! This is not a book to learn the theoretical aspects of deep-learning, rather it is a collection of hands-on examples to work through and learn by experience and the guidance provided by the author. That said, if you have seen neural networks from the 1990s along with the back propagation algorithm, and you can visualize the concepts of gradient descent and convolution, then this material is very easy to followThe examples are setup on the Keras framework using TensorFlow as the backend engine. I used an EC2 p2.xlarge instance as suggested by the author. The setup required a bit of help beyond what's provided in Appendix B. Once setup though you will need to run from a virtual environment: ""source activate tensorflow_p36"". . . . . . My final thought is that after having read Chapter 7, I want to do a second pass using callbacks and tensorboard for better insight."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Buon libro per principianti, con spiegazioni chiare delle tecniche basilari del Deep learning ed esempi utili per implementare vari casi di classificazione. Il codice presentato nel libro è ben documentato e aggiornato alle recenti versioni dei tool per machine/Deep learning comunemente usate. La parte di Deep learning per computer vision riguarda soprattutto esempi di classificazione di immagini e oggetti, mancano esempi di altri tipi di elaborazione che richiederebbero un diverso tipo di training data (come ad esempio segmentazione o rimozione di rumore). Funzioni come upscaling non sono discusse. La descrizione delle conclusioni potrebbe essere forse arricchita con esempi dei filtri che ci si aspetta che la rete calcoli.Nel complesso do 4 stelle e consiglio questo libro a chiunque voglia imparare i concetti principali del Deep learning e incominciare ad usarlo."

Als Anfänger der schon auf anderen Wegen versucht hat sich Deep Learning beizubringen kann ich nur sagen das dieses Buch bisher die beste Quelle für mich war, vor allem da es auch verständlichen Code liefert mit dem man seine eigenen Projekte verbessern kann.Empfehlen würde Ich es für jeden der bereits Python Kentnisse hat und an einer einfachen und nicht technischen Einführung in die Thematik interessiert ist. Ich denke es ist nicht geeignet für Leser, welche bereits in der Materie sind da es keine mathematischen Herleitungen oder ähnliches enthält.Alles in allem bin ich sehr zufrieden mit dem Kauf."

The book tries to explain the theory and intuitive idea behind the learning itself.

Even if they were bigger, the pixel size is large enough that they appear a little bit pixellated already.  Enlarging them probably would exacerbate it.Get the hardback version instead."

En gros, il le fait lire à tout décideur ou investisseur qu'il croise...Il est vrai que l'ouvrage de Pedro Domingos est remarquable à plus d'un titre :Il est complet et brosse l'évolution des algorithmes d’auto-apprentissage depuis le début jusqu'à maintenant; il les classes par rapport au modèles qu'ils cherchent à reproduire : cerveau, évolution des espèces, béhaviorisme, réseaux bayésiens, ...les exemples sont nombreux et facilitent la compréhension des enjeux et des limitations de chaque école. Il montre aussi la manière dont ces écoles progressent au travers des échecs parfois cuisant de certaine applications.A défaut d'un ""Master Algorithm"", espèce de Graal ou d'anneau de Sauron (suivant le jugement que l'on porte) qui unifierait l'ensemble des écoles, le lecteur avisé se posera quelques questions avant de se lancer dans un projet impliquant l'usage de l'Intelligence Artificielle. Par exemple le dilemme rapidité - exactitude, le coût de l'erreur, l'importance d'un optimum ultime par rapport à un optimum local, la taille de la base d'apprentissage disponible ...Par delà un voyage dans l'intelligence artificielle, l'ouvrage fait réfléchir à chaque page sur notre propre perception du monde, sur notre propre mécanisme d'apprentissage. Chaque école en effet tire son origine de grands philosophes et de grans scientifiques.Seul bémol qu me fait enlever une étoile est le début du livre qui adopte un ton un peu trop prosélyte à mon goût. Heureusement, ce ton est vite abandonné au profit d'une écriture très digeste et d'un récit passionnant."

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Master Algorithm is a reasonable overview of the growing field of machine learning.  The author explores the idea of there being a master algorithm which could explain everything given enough data.  The idea seems a bit over the top when initially phrased but the real purpose of the book is to introduce ideas used in machine learning and how they work and are used to solve problems.The book is split into multiple chapters which start from discussing abstractly the master algorithm and then move on to some of the philosophical issues associated with using such algorithms.  In particular the author discusses at the core of believing in pattern recognition algorithms is belief in inductive reasoning.  The author discusses human learning and gets into some neuroscience and how neural networks are constructed.  The reader gets a vague sense of Hebbian learning and how neuron weighting are at the core of neural networks.  The author spends a lot of time discussing various approaches in machine learning and gives the reader an intuitive feel of Bayesian learning.  The author was an originator in a particular algorithm called naïve Bayes which greatly simplified solutions to certain problems and so the author introduces his ideas to the reader.  Other machine learning ideas are introduced like genetic programming and multivariable regression.  The author also discusses other machine learning algorithms which turn data into a vector and then look for close neighbors of the vector to classify the input.  The author also spends some time on how unsupervised learning would look.  The book combines computer science ideas and intuition and tries to use a fictitious robot as the means to convey ideas about how a computer would learn.  The author finally introduces his own master algorithm called alchemy which combines most of the models described in the book.  The reader really gets little actual sense of what's going on in the algorithm as the author qualifies one needs a PhD in computer science.The Master Algorithm is the first book I have seen which introduces some of the ideas being used in machine learning to a general audience.  It does so quite well and most of the ideas are absorbable.  At the same time there are a few too many instances where the author is self promoting talking about all of the brilliant ideas he has had which have reshaped the field and how other areas of AI research of the past or Kurzweil and his singularity concept are idiotic.  Despite probably being right in much of his analysis its arguing with no one on the other side and unproductive.  Also the flavor of the writing is odd -  it turns into some fantasy literature at times as though that makes the subject more digestible and in fact makes it more irritating.  I enjoyed reading aspects of the book and do think the parts on what different schools of machine learning focus on are well written for a non expert, unfortunately there are many other parts of the book which one wants to get through as quickly as possible."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"AWESOME OVERVIEW OF ML IDEASI have read a few textbooks on machine learning (intro to Statistical Learning by Hastie etc) and so I would say that my knowledge of ML is at the ""textbook overview"" level. Since I am not a ML practitioner, I may not be the best judge of a book such as this one, it was a fairly difficult read, and I know I need to read the book a second time to get an even greater appreciation and understanding of the concepts covered by the author. That being said, it was a very enjoyable book. The book was very different from any ML book that I've read or checked out either at a bookstore or online. I think one needs to have some knowledge of ML to appreciate the book - concepts like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, Bayesian inference, support vector machines, neural networks, etc .... The book deserves a 5-star rating because it added a lot of value to my understanding of ML, and increased my desire and curiosity to learn more about the field of ML ...."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Part of the reason I bought this book was to see if I can still understand current issues in computer science, 30 years after I earned my M.S. in C.S. Back then the hot book in the field was The Soul of a New Machine, by Tracy Kidder, which I very much enjoyed. But time moves on, and some issues that were hard then, such as the four color problem, have been solved since. Artificial Intelligence, on the other hand, has not. Back in 1989, I fully expected some computer to have passed the Turing Test by now, but doing so has proved more difficult than then expected, although computers now routinely trounce human experts in even the most complex games, such as Chess and Go.Thus, I chose this book both to see why we aren't there yet, and to see if I can still even follow the current arguments.Like The Soul of a New Machine, this book is written to both be accessible to a literate general audience and rigorous enough for specialists. In my opinion, it entirely succeeds, although my son is better than me at math, so I skimmed some of the math-heavy discussions, as my interest is more in the philosophical issues and predictions about coming developments. In that, I was completely satisfied, as just when I was thinking of docking a star because the discussion was getting too deep into the weeds of particular implementations of machine learning, the author returned to a very interesting discussion of what it all means for our current and future society, complete with useful predictions about what jobs are still likely to be around in twenty years, and the inevitability of voters eventually approving a guaranteed basic income for those no longer able to be employed due to robots and computers doing ever more of the work previously done by humans.I was glad to see the author also explored the dark side of all this - the potential for it to control people rather than to free them, and his suggestions on how to make sure the changes achieve good for all rather than for only a few. I was particularly interested in his conclusion that we needn't worry about machines ruling over us because even the best machine learners lack will, doing only what they have been programmed to do. I also like his idea that although machine learning may be the next step in evolution, it will be one taken with rather than instead of us, with humans branching out along with computers in ways not predictable yet, but likely to be beneficial.Overall, a very good and very hopeful read, and comforting to still be able to follow along after a full career since grad school and years of retirement.Definitely recommended!"
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had very high expectations going into this book, and initially it did not disappoint.  The introductory chapter provides a general explanation on machine learning that is second to none, the abstract concept of a ""master algorithm"" works as a clever construct to frame the problem of machine learning and the five different ways to arrive at it.  The author also establishes rapport with the reader by sprinkling his insights with humor (albeit professor-type humor) and the passion that drives him also comes through.  Having lost his beloved sister to cancer, he presents many cancer-related examples to show machine learning's potential.Unfortunately, as he gets into the details of each of the five approaches towards the master algorithm it gets more and more difficult to understand him.  I left the chapter on Bayesian learning more confused about Bayes than I did going in, and by the time I got to the final chapter that synthesizes them into a whole, I could not get much out of it.  I think what makes this book less accessible to the lay reader are the long sections of dense prose, with no supporting graphics, and the author's tendency to define important concepts, such as ""inverse deduction"", in passing and not too clearly, and then builds on those concepts to explain even more abstract ideas.  At times the author gets carried away in his explanations in the same way that some professors do in their excitement about an idea, oblivious to his having lost the majority of the classroom.  In conclusion, the book requires a lot of dedication from the lay reader, it is not to be read quickly, and one can only hope that there will be a second edition that will make it a bit more accessible."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"TLDR: the book is awesome, it really is on another level, and you will be stuck in the past if you don't ingest this book.If you are not in the target audience I think you will find this book hard to digest.  Also I have read some chapters twice and worked through the code samples, so I believe I offer a perspective that other readers may be lacking.  Marcos has given a number of lectures titled  “The 7 Reasons Most Machine Learning Funds Fail”, you can find the lecture slides online.  The seven core ideas in that lecture are covered in chapters 2-8, with other chapters offering supporting details, or going further in depth.  If you have limited time to process the book, I think you would be better served by taking a deep dive on chapters 2-8, rather than skimming the whole thing.The ideas in this book work, and you would be doing yourself a disservice by not reading this book.  Some of the ideas range from the common sense (backtesting is not a research tool, feature importance is) to the heretical (""fordecades most financial research has been based on over-differentiated (memory-less) series, leading to spurious forecasts and overfitting."")  [That quote was in his 7 Reasons presentation from Quantcon 2018, not the book.]  He offers compelling arguments and solutions backed by peer reviewed publications for all his points.The book would be a highly valuable reference even without the code snippets, but he provides functional code and even tools to make it work on large datasets.  Once again this code is not for the faint of heart, his use of Pandas will leave even a seasoned financial developer to RTFM.There are some flaws which I can overlook.  Strict software engineers will be irked at the code violating PEP8.  It is hard to put code samples into a book so things like multiple statements per line can greatly compact the code and make it readable.  In chapter 20 he uses threads and processes interchangeably although they are two distinct tools.  Chapter 22 felt a little out of place but it seems compulsory for financial authors to include a ""just for fun"" final chapter.  There was a quick discussion at the end of Chapter 14 on performance attribution, which felt rushed and I feel it would be hard for the non-financial portion of the target audience to follow.  These are minor items.  I found at least three errors in the code which I hear have been corrected in the second printing.It is arguable that the ideas in this book could be extended to any asset class.  If I had to guess, I would say this was often applied to trading futures, although bonds, equities, and equity options are briefly mentioned."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this book, but the kindle edition is full of weird artifacts. This has rendered many in-line mathematical formulas largely unintelligible. For an example, every logical expression for ""x and y"", where the ""and"" should be a wedge, has instead been converted into a caret, which in every case is floating almost directly over the first variable. In another example, there is a reference to the ""one-element vector h0.6i."" It seems that the h and i were probably brackets originally, but it is impossible to tell.In the real book there are words in the left margin that indicate where in the text a word has been first defined. In the kindle edition these are replaced with immense horizontal bands across the entire page with horizontal rules above and below, taking up three full rows of text, and they appear below the text that they refer to. Three of those in one paragraph, and you're lucky to even get the paragraph on the same screen with them, much less use them as a nice guide to where words are defined. All practical use they had in the real book is completely obliterated, and now they just take up a lot of room on the screen and make the book harder to read.In the few places where they've kept the original formulas by means of images, the images look a little like they came from a malfunctioning copier. This is less of a problem than the other issues, but it is still annoying.Overall a big thumb's down on the kindle edition!"

The way machine learning is described is that the typical method for computing is to give the machine an input and write the algorithm and then receive the output, whereas with machine learning you give the computer inputs and outputs and it writes the algorithm.The main theme is to integrate all of the current methods to form a master algorithm that can do everything. While this sounds daunting, the author builds up his case starting from describing the current (as of 2015) five main approaches: symoblists, connectionists, evolutionaries, bayesians, and analogizers. Each group is broken down into their formal language used, method of evaluation, and method to evaluate and refine. This history is enough to recommend the book and Domingos does a good job of comparing and contrasting the different tribes. He coves the ubiquitous problem of over-fitting and explains why testing on unseen data is the ultimate verification method.While there are many interesting ideas, I found a lot of the presentation to be unclear and somewhat vague. This could be due to my ignorance of the subject. He also undercuts his entire thesis at the beginning by granting Hume's problem of induction as a given. This demonstrates the importance of the proper philosophical ideas when addressing fundamental topics.I am actually less optimistic about all of this after reading this. It still seems very far off with some major obstacles. With that being said, I admire the author's passion and interest in the subject and am grateful to have the information he's provided. I noticed he now works in the finance industry and I would be very interested to hear if he has more or less confidence with Machine Learning now versus when the book was written, over 5 years ago. Even with its faults, highly recommend."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ultimately, this book was able to guide me to a basic understanding of several approaches to machine learning, potential directions similar algorithms may take us in the future, and several surprising insights about how humans learn. I am glad I read it, and I would recommend it to students of machine learning. Domingos is not just an expert in his field; he understands how machine learning draws from and influences many other fields of study: ethics, philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, genetics, economics, politics, etc. His apt quotes and examples bring these connections to life. I especially enjoyed his illustrations in the form of poetry and fantasy.However, for a lay person looking for a guide to the machine learning revolution, this book seems like it has been mauled by the complexity monster. Each promising ""tribe"" of machine learning, complete with its backstory, is explained in technical detail far beyond what I was looking for. Domingos does provide illustrations and fitting analogies to mitigate this, and he tells that the scientists of the tribes of machine learning are like the proverbial blind men touching the elephant: ""Our aim is to touch each part without jumping to conclusions; and once we’ve touched all of them, we will try to picture the whole elephant."" But I didn't really want to feel the whole elephant, especially not the yucky parts."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Took me a while to decide whether to give three or four stars. On one side, the book explains the five schools of thought to machine learning and does with great detail. On the other hand, after starting off with an adequate level (from my view anyway, I hold a masters degree in telecom engineering) it became more and more obscure, to the point where I found myself skipping some of the explanations in the last chapters hoping to come to the end where the author would recap and resume it all in clearer terms. I guess the matter is complex enough that requires careful reading, meaning re-reading chapters two, three times and often coming back to where you started to feel lost. That's my only critique and considering it may be my lack of energy to do this, I think it well deserves four stars.The author definitely gained me back at the last chapter, a good resume of what AI and machine learning means, what isn't and what holds for the future. The recommended readings chapter is full of materials to keep learning, which i might do as this is one of the few areas today where everything can still be done."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a very readable introduction to machine learning by an expert practitioner. It outlines the five major current approaches and goes into each in some detail. It covers the history of each approach. It does not avoid the underlying philosophical issues but touches on them only lightly. The author gives his more personal speculations that the five approaches are different aspects of the same thing and on the possibility of an emerging kind of master learning algorithm. He finishes off with some views on how this relates to the future of humans and human society in a world where the machines are vastly more intelligent and vastly better informed. He is perhaps surprisingly optimistic that it will all turn out ok. I guess he has to be otherwise he would be guilty of knowingly working on that which will ultimately destroy us ... or not. Who knows.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good book for the novice to get a better understanding of Machine Learning.  Pedro Domingos writes interestingly about the history of machine learning and the current search for the master algorithm.  He discusses the five different tribes of algorithms in detail:symbolists/inverse decutionconnectionists/backpropogationevolutionaries/genetic algorithmsBayesians/probabilistic inferenceanalogizers/support vector machinesAnd explains all of them are meant to do the same 3 things: represent, evaluate and optimize.I do feel that more charts and graphs would have augmented and reinforced the learning experience."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is great. It is the first book about machine learning I've ever read which provides a comprehensive explanation of all branches of the technology. The author calls these the five tribes of machine learning and covers the origins and developments of each one. According to Domingos, the so-called master algorithm would be a composition of the main algorithms developed by the tribes, each one contributing to the one aspect of learning in which it is more powerful. However, it is a difficult book to read. Being a software engineer, I had a really hard time trying to figure out the basics and the mathematics of the algorithms just by reading the textual explanations provided by the author. That is the reason I am not rating it five stars. It would be great it Domingos had used more figures, examples, and some mathematical notations to explain the concepts. But I understand that, maybe,  he tried to avoid to make the book more accessible to non-technical people. Anyway, it is a great book and it worths reading it."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Difficult choice based on an unidimensional 5 stars rating system. The author has deep understanding and long experience in the field. No doubts. That makes the book worth reading 100%However from an outsider to the Silicon Valley and US tribe his conclusions and recommendations are hard to swallow. Example :  it is an ethical and moral duty of any cancer patient to share its data... to companies that will create a model to cure cancer. Good in principle, so this company will make millions to sell a magic cancer cure that only the reaches could afford, and even the poorest person in the poorest corner of the world has the moral duty to share its data and not benefit from it?More like this in a larger review, but the optimism that the author shows only can rise an eyebrow, after the recent news on the failure of the top machine learners companies (Facebook, Google and Twitter), with their algorithms used to swing electoral decisions, spread fake news (the real fake ones, not the other type) and do not stop, some argue encourage, harassment and hate speech... the jury hasn't decide yet, but a lot is amiss for sure.However read it: the description of the different algorithms is great for a newbie and layman, good historical context and well explained. First and last chapters is where I strongly disagree with the author: and the reason is because he made political statements, so of course you will have different ones. The impact on technology, why citizens of the world should share its data, have a strong Silicon Valley US perspective. He is open about that: this is open for discussion and better to talk about it rather than hide our heads in a hole. Sure! The author has good intentions and some of his far fetched recommendations are off, again my humble opinion. Particularly you can see that when after mentioning the good impact of AI technology in the labor markets and elaborating on a future utopia (a nation will be more advanced the highest the unemployment ratio is - year, interesting) and next section is about the benefits of intelligent (AI) robot full driven wars: yes, two robots armies fighting to the end in an orgy of mindless destruction like WW1, is more human... but he imagines that everybody will have robot armies, and that they will train the ethics model (when to shoot or not) based on the same rules! Extreme: imagine the ISIS trainer teaching ethics (when shoot/not shoot); and if you think they will not get the tech, imagine Assad getting a grip on the tech... and Putin, anyone really: the logic of battle is that you will use your resources to the maximum benefit for you, meaning killing your opponent with less casualties. Do you want to control that? Do not start a war.The author is convince that humans will keep to do humans things, and he cannot see the contradiction of one faction or economy of the planet having access to a literally overwhelming technology: asymmetry will be impossible to contain.The biggest mistake is to put to much faith (literally) in that technology will help create a nice utopia (just after describing the benefits of AI apply to war).As a final is good reading, the author acknowledges that he has not all the answers, that it is open to discussion and that the ostrich tactic does not work: agree, it does not make sense to stop research, and put fictitious barriers to technological advancement."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I knocked off one star because this book, no matter what the blurbs say, is definitely *not* for the people working in the field, or for graduate students taking relevant courses.But, it was perfect for some of my collaborators in molecular biology and genomics and such who wanted to know what the fuss is all about without having to do any algebra. Three of them bought it, all three liked it. Good for PhD students in non-computational fields."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have run through a quick pass of the entire text in one sitting, so I may possibly re-read more in depth and alter my review at some point in the future.My impression is that the text reads a bit like an academic survey of some existing ML methods applied to quantitative finance, a bit heavy on theoretical models and sourcing many fairly recent papers culled from various financial and machine learning literature, many referenced from the author himself. However, the author also points out that he has a lot of experience in the quantitative field and elaborates a bit on the overall systematic step by step process of development that a real team of quants might use. Don't expect an in depth description of specific implementations (like SVMs, Gradient Boosting, NNs,etc), but a more general approach to the various learner methods.The Good:I enjoyed getting his perspective on the overall flow and piece by piece breakdown on each of the steps involved in the process of developing a ML based algorithm, from data collection, partitioning, and scrubbing, all the way to the design and execution phase, including a lengthy description of some of the pitfalls and possible solutions to using various cross-validation methods, in order to gain better confidence in financial data and algorithms, that many already know suffer from characteristics like non-IID properties, data overlap, and time dependencies. On the more concrete side, he also presents many standalone python based functions to concretely implement many of the concepts that he describes.The bad:While it definitely reads like it is written from someone with a strong theoretical background, and much experience in the financial field. I also, felt that it fails in that it never really integrates all of the build up to a practical example of a systematic design implementation, that uses many of his ideas and demonstrates their validity. In other words, do not expect any top level concrete design or systematic design and back-test examples with real financial data and results at all.  It is mainly bits and pieces of the pipeline that ultimately may go into a complete systematic development of a system, but no real evidence that any of it is of use, other than to take the author's word, or just accept the theoretical modelling. To clarify further, it's ok to point out the shortcomings of classical portfolio optimization, but show a clear example of an ML based portfolio optimization; how does it perform using various validation methods compared to classical? Using real, cleaned financial data.It would definitely be useful to see at least one complete implementation of a system that utilizes the methods described within. In addition, concepts like quantum computing are great and all, but when you've been at this development long enough, the more fancy and advanced the tools sound, they don't really bring all that much to the table, if you can't even develop a successful system or algorithm at a much simpler level (which is not easy).update(s): I'll just add that, after a closer reading, hasn't really changed my opinion much. However, if it helps anyone I found an excellent simulation of HRP, using real financial data on ilya kipnis great R based blog, QuantStratTradeR. This is the kind of empirical data, that would really add value to the text."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"With a few exceptions, there is nothing ""advanced"" in the book.  It is a cut-and-paste of techniques that are well known, and then applies a global search-and-replace to use financial examples rather than the examples that have been typically applied to the techniques. And because of that, there is not a theme running through it. I have found various of the author's papers useful, and this book might have been better done as a compendium of those papers.And I question the use of the term ""machine learning"", even though it is more broadly applied to various of these techniques. Is bootstrapping, for example, machine learning? How about regression trees? It is using a machine, obviously, as is anything that involves data analysis. But does ""learning"" capture anything about the essence of the technique? I would say 80% of what he is doing is a rehash of data analysis methods most anyone who has not been indoctrinated in econometrics -- which is to say everyone in a field other than economics -- knows and applies."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having spent more than two decades on equity desks building cash and options systems, it is refreshing to come across a book that is so comprehensive. The first part of the book tackles the construction of a data strategy. Marcos provides both theoretical foundations as well as practical examples for those building a data plant geared towards both general trading as well as focusing on machine learning driven strategies. The second part of the book focuses on extending basic machine learning concepts to financial data. The author spends a lot of this section focusing on validation techniques specifically for financial features. The third section of the book focuses entirely on backtesting. In this section, he develops a number of novel approaches to backtesting machine learning models as well as measuring the performance of those models. The fourth section delves into some of the most important ML features in financial markets and how to build models around them. The last section focuses on how to scale your ML models with both off the shelf software, high performance computing hardware(via LBNL's CIFT Project), and quantum computing approaches(via quantum annealer from D-WAVE). All in all, the book provides an excellent roadmap for building and operating ML based trading strategies."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is  an essential addition to the machine learning and finance literature.  It’s hard to summarize in a review how important this book is but if quantitative finance is of any professional interest to you, I recommend purchasing this book and devoting an hour per day to it. In short, I would highlight three important contributions: i) the book explains the mesh point between machine learning and finance, and how  it’s not as simple as taking the principles of ML and applying to them to asset management, ii) the book emphasizes and deconstructs how ML for finance should be viewed as a scientific process, with discrete and highly specialized steps/teams. iii) the book is an end to end, or bottom to top treatment of a complex subject. It starts with the building blocks, the stuff that a lot of people want to skip: messy, unstructured data. It then goes step by step, with code, to the end of the process. I personally am an R coder so I can’t speak to the specifics of the Python code except to say that Dr. Prado does not wave his hands - he writes the code.My only point of disagreement is that Dr. Prado sets high prerequisites for the reader such as prior mastery of Python and application of ML in finance or at least an unrelated field. If there are 100 lessons in this book, I agree that those prerequisites are needed to learn all 100 lessons. But a reader with data science, finance (not to the level recommended by the author) and coding experience with R, I still learned an immense amount in this book - maybe I learned only 20 of the 100 lessons but those 20 are crucial for setting out in the right direction.  For example, my understanding of backtest overfitting was greatly advanced by the book. That alone was worth the read."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're coming from a computer science and/or machine learning background, you will learn a lot about how to frame your algorithmic thinking in the domain of finance and will leave you hungry for more hardcore graph theory, parallelization, machine learning (beyond simple random forest ensembles and clustering), advanced algorithms, and gutty details of implementation, which are left for you to explore and enjoy.The purpose of this book is not to explain how to apply Deep Learning to make money, but rather to lay a solid foundation of how to invest in a scientifically rigorous fashion given the modern machine learning toolset and access to PBs of data. In many cases, rather than focussing on the specifics of any given model, Dr. Lopez de Prado focuses on generating and selecting useful features.The book, which is a hybrid of a textbook and a manual, explains using both formal mathematics and empirical evidence why many of the assumptions about Machine Learning applied to the financial world are wrong and follows through with rigorous and practical solutions. For example, one of the most common false assumptions addressed in the book is that of IID samples in financial time series data.Dr. Lopez de Prado manages to pull together ideas from a wide spectrum of academic disciplines including mathematics, econometrics, machine learning, computer science, information theory, and physics to build a strong scientific basis upon which to algorithmically invest. Despite the diversity of subject matter, the book progresses well, building on and reusing early themes and then exploring domain specific topics like market microstructure and quantum computing. Source code to implement many of the methods is provided as a practical toolkit to test out the claims presented. The thorough use of references is particularly helpful as it keeps the content fairly short and to the point.Speed reading not recommended. Using a programming analogy, the mathematical notation is more reminiscent of the explicit verbosity of C++ than that of python (which is used in the book and is meant to be concise). It's not much of a problem but be aware the information content is dense.Something that's mentioned but not explored is how to make use of “alternative datasets”. Given many of the advances in the wider realm of ML have been around data you don’t get from exchanges, it would be nice if some helpful pointers or references for dealing with alternative data were included. That said, it's not the end of the world given the wealth of resources online for analyzing text, image, and video data.Buy this book if you're an experienced programmer getting into Finance or a Financial Professional looking to strengthen your algorithmic understanding. It is densely packed with a wealth of practical methods and breaks down and offers alternatives to faulty investing science."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First a meta review. When I started reading the book a very finance-centric question came up, why has Marcos de Prado decided to share with the public his experience and knowledge on algorithmic trading using machine learning (ML)? We all know that virtually all quantitative hedge funds are very secretive not just about trading strategies, but also about their research process and even data sets.The answer to this question seems to be in the first chapter. The author would like to contribute to a world where finance implies science and investing rather than guessing and gambling. I think he was able to find a perspective where investing is not a zero-sum game, but a tool that can have a positive impact on society if deployed using sound scientific methods.Now about the content itself. The book is a tour de force that guides the reader through different domains that are necessary, alas not sufficient, to achieve good results (e.g. signal processing, parallel computing, statistics, market microstructure). What emerges is a broad perspective that educates the audience about the challenges of using machine learning for researching trading strategies.Finance is not a domain where ML algorithms and methodologies taught in textbooks can be directly applied. The underlying processes are non-stationary, the way data are sampled from price time-series is crucial and they have low signal-to-noise ratio. What the author does is exactly to approach challenges by first recognizing them and describing principles and techniques to deal with them. For example, a recurrent theme throughout the book is the fragility of backtesting and how to mitigate its deleterious effect.In order to get the most out of this book, read it many times as you research your own algorithms. At the very least it will serve as a sanity check."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well-written, well-researched book that provides new insight in many areas; much better than your run-of-the-mill book that gives a cursory overview of topics like ML and finance. It's obvious from reading this book that the author knows what he's talking about. The book is for people who already know something about both ML and machine trading systems; it's not an introduction. A major theme of the book is the danger of backtest overfitting.Highly recommended!An overview of topics follows, focusing on things I found the most useful.Part 1: Data Analysis (chapters 1-5)Chapter 1 includes a list of reasons that financial ML projects usually fail. It's nice to have the warning at the outset of what traps to avoid.Chapter 2 discusses ways to represent market information; there are surprises here you wouldn't think of on your own, such as ""Tick Imbalance Bars"", which show up here only because the author has significant experience in HFT (cf. one of his earlier books on market microstructure.)Chapter 3 on Labelling addresses some issues I ran into myself working on dataset preparation. How to do appropriate labelling in computational finance isn't as obvious as in some other ML domains. Chapter 4 continues with appropriate weights for data samples, which help deal with data that violates the IID assumption.I knew the basics of ARIMA processes and the idea of time series stationarity before reading this book, but Chapter 5 introduced me to fractionally differentiated time series, which appears in earlier literature in the 1980s, but which somehow I had missed. This is important in dealing with time series with long memory.Part 2, Modeling (chapters 6-9)Part 2 has a different focus than some readers might expect, talking about modeling in general, but without mentioning specific ML models, such as linear regressions, neural nets, random forests, etc. The book states in its introduction that it is intended to be model-agnostic, and covers issues affecting modeling in general.Chapter 6, for instance, is on ensembles. Chapter 7 deals with cross-validation in financial time series, which is a crucial topic for any model evaluation, and chapter 8 talks about feature importance. Chapter 9 is on hyper-parameter tuning.Part 3: Backtesting (chapters 10-16).Chapter 10 covers bet sizing.Chapter 11-16 discuss backtesting in great detail, including the dangers involved, good statistics to compute, synthetic data use, more on cross-validation, and strategy risk and asset allocation/optimization.Part 4 (chapters 17-19) is called ""Useful Financial Features"" -- it's about feature engineering, and has a bunch of features that will be new to many readers (there are ""entropy features"" and ""microstructure features"", for instance; this isn't just the basic stuff related to returns and volatility.Part 5 (chapters 20-22) seemed the least useful to me, on high-performance computing, since I personally was already aware of this stuff and there is a lot more to say on the topic than these few chapters could cover."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A Gigantic thanks to Dr Marcos for putting this book out there. It is up to the image and the reputation of those world class finance authorities, such as Pr Peter Carr and Pr Frank Fabozzi .Despite being very cheap in compliments, mostly when it comes down to books, i can say that this book is up to the images of those who supported it. This book is the culmination of many fundamental and practical knowledge in Mathematics and Finance. It can help one understand some cutting edges techniques and technologies that can be used as springboard  towards responding to the most perpetual questions in quantitative finance.It is a ""must to get book"" as it can create layers of abilities to implement complex models and well structured investment strategies.Congratulations!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a student pursuing both academic and professional knowledge for sound mathematical and empirical based experience in higher finance, Marcos Lopez de Prado’s career serves as an inspiration for my pursuit of truth. To gain data integrity in understanding the ever-changing differences in higher finance,  FinTech, big data, machine learning, and quantum computing  are making distinct changes in looking at a financial trading model. After all, looking at a financial trading model, one must adopt a skeptical data mindset in order to formulate investor credibility from Bloomberg pulled data. Drilling down to data credibility, Prado examines various factors that obscure a supply data model and therefore reduce the information that may be derived. Given a large and diverse supply population, backtesting becomes a crucial retrospective that may give pointers to trading forecasts, but they are only pointers; looking backwards is at best simple guide forecasting. Complex, and often hard to understand topic are covered, which are essential reads for anyone interested in financial risk analysis, financial data, software, hardware, math.  meta-strat, and overfitting are covered and defining the sharpe ratio and its common derivatives, such as common derivatives such as Deflated Sharpe Ratio after its extensive earlier use are covered. Several strategic risk and then portfolio risk are well covered in focusing on Asset Allocation, reviewing Markowitz’s Curse, Tree Clustering, Out-of-Sample Monte Carlo Simulations, Inverse Variance Allocation and others. Shannon’s Entropy and other financial applications of entropy then follow as does a review of Microstructural Feature publications including various Lamda’s such as Kyle’s and Hasbrouck’s. Simple illustrations conclude with brute force in Quantum Computing to find optimum solutions by examining all feasible solutions at the same time. Considering the maturity of Quantum Computing, the amount of advances especially to standard models somewhat lacking.  In terms of discerning the academic science from the empirical based evidence, Lopez de Prado’s work is an incredible usage of both academic and practitioner truth, in terms of accurately using mathematical tools to describe actual observations. In a constant skeptical approach from pseudo science to mathematical precision, Lope de Prado adopts a framework of explanations to describe actual relevant changes in quantitative finance."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I will start by saying up front: this is a challenging book.  It is worth the effort, however.  Lopez de Prado assumes the reader is already very familiar with investment management in an institutional context, and further assumes familiarity with the fundamentals of machine learning.  If you don't have those tools in your kit already, this is not the book for you.The focus of the book is on robust applications of various ML techniques to financial data, mostly stocks, but the concepts could be applied to other assets classes.  The book also emphasizes a particular (healthy) obsession the author has about poorly constructed backtests, which most practitioners have experienced first-hand, when a promising investment strategy that performs well in historical simulations but then fails utterly in the real world.The author does not provide a companion website or github with the code that would be needed to implement the ideas in the book, but there is abundant pseudo-code throughout, so doing so would be possible for a reasonably competent python or R programmer.  (Other people have tried to produce python projects on github covering the material in the book but I have not rigorously tested them. YMMV.)There are lots of people who claim to be using ML in their investment strategies, and most of them are frankly BS.  If you want to do ML right, this book is essential for developing an approach to researching and testing your strategies so they can be implemented in real markets using real money."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A text that makes it through a third edition means it is popular. This is intended for advanced undergraduate and first-year graduate level classes. Its structure is pure old-fashioned textbook. No bells, no whistles, no sidebars, no ornamentation. Necessary charts, illustrations and graphs are primitive. Fortunately, the two authors write in a reasonable clear way, pretty much free of academic phrasing. The goal is to teach the technology of turning masses of data into useful and usable information. The approach is very straight-forward and methodical. First, the authors explain what data mining is and move quickly into describing data, processing data, reducing data and, generally, organizing data for retrieval of information. There are exercises at the end of each chapter. The authors claim they wrote the book not only as a classroom text, but as ""an excellent handbook"" on the subject of data mining. It is that, but whether as a classroom student or on your own, you'd better have a reasonably solid understanding of statistics, match, C programming, database structure and more. In short, this is not an easy book for an easy subject. But it is a thorough, if very technical, introduction to data mining. Essentially only the serious need apply. Those who just need a general knowledge of data mining would best look elsewhere.Jerry"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Data Mining is a comprehensive overview of the field, and I think it is best for a graduate class in data mining, or perhaps as a reference book. The book's focus is on technique (i.e., how to analyze data, including preparation), and it addresses all the major topics in the field including data storage and pre-processing. However, the book is really about classification methods, and the 2 chapters on cluster analysis are particularly strong and thorough.For those looking for specific examples, applications, and domain knowledge, I would recommend   Data Mining Techniques: For Marketing, Sales, and Customer Relationship Management           by Linoff & Berry. However, for analytic techniques, this reference book is far superior."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This hard cover handbook and text in Machine Learning and Data Mining Techniques gives a wide and understandable overview of these methods. More than 80% of the text is readily understandable without recourse to advanced statistical and linear algebra methods, due to extensive verbal description of the nature of these algorithms and their applications, as well as illustrations and pseudocode algorithms.  Unlike the other excellent text in the Morgan Kaufman series by Witten, Frank and Hall there is no emphasis on a particular data mining package (I own both texts). Slightly more treatment is provided of two important modern Machine Learning Methods--Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.This is a modern and understandable treatment of the important topics of Data Mining and Machine Learning designed to be used as a classroom text."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a jam-packed textbook covering everything from ""what is data mining?"" to ""speeding up constrained clustering with obstacles"".The math and statistics put this as a high level computer science course, and I doubt this material can be worked through in one semester without picking focus areas of interest.  Students should have backgrounds in Linear Algebra, Databases, and enough C/C++ or similar level language to understand complex pseudocode.This 2nd Edition has 630 pages organized into 13 chapters:1.

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques book is detailed, well-organized with good introduction. Every chapter has sub-headings and it is in a nice order explained with figures. There is introduction in the beginning of the chapter but it would be sufficient if you already read a data mining book. If you want to read more introduction it is better to go through few more books. There are small examples and exercises throughout the book. There is exclusively a chapter dedicated for outlier detection. This is better than few other data mining books that I had referred for the reason it covers a wide range of topics. There is detailed introduction about each chapter of the book. The contents of this book is available in pdf format and also there are slide presentations for each chapter. It is definitely worth reading this book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was written to be a textbook from the start, complete with question-sets from at the end of every chapter. If you're a student you won't have any choice as to the book selection, however if you are looking at this more from a practical commercial standpoint you will have many choices and this may not be the best one. I think in many ways it tries to be very encyclopedic and covers a huge amount of background information that is probably perfunctory in industry. The book would be more useful as a desk reference with heavy editing, more real-life examples... perhaps along the lines of case studies that may fit outside of a curriculum based arc.Minuses:- Not very illustrative, when there are diagrams and visual examples they tend to be very bare bones- Some of the screen shots are absolutely terrible resolution (ex. page 602/603)"

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I plod through a wide variety of books that touch on AI, robotics, Sci-Fi, existentialism, mind/self/consciousness.  I chose this book primarily because Bill Gates recommended it.  About midway through, I began to doubt my ability to keep up with BG (self deprecating sarcasm intended).  I became lost in even this casual overview of the five tribes of machine learning algorithms.  When the author then force fit them together like parts from different jigsaw puzzles, I scanned and turned pages quickly.  Yet I'm glad I came out on the other end because the author followed that with the obligatory far sighted speculation of where ML will take our species, what some of the risks are along with some possible remediation, and a sunny prognostication of evolution from homo sapien to homo technicus with myriad sub-species happily coexisting with each other.  Given all of the techno-angst in the news, it is refreshing to hear someone say that this too will pass, evolution is on our side and life will continue to evolve in ways we can barely imagine today.  The ML logic of this book won't convince you of this.  Even the author says that the Master Algorithm, one to rule them all, hasn't been invented (discovered?) yet, but he is confident that it is only a matter of time, maybe less time than we think."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read it in two nights. Maybe I should say skimmed the heavier math sections. I'm 35 years out of college so it was a challenge. Still i get the idea. Great references and excellent coverage if Google's open source TensorFlow. Now I will take his prerequisite courses on Udemy. If your calc is still pretty fresh then you will love it. Even if you are rusty but remember the concepts of Linear Algebra, matrix manipulation and ideally multi variable calculus then you will love it."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a doctoral student of machine learning, and I can recommend this book for everyone interested in the current state of machine learning and artificial intelligence, aspiring scholars and laypersons alike. It gives a fairly good idea of the main techniques and schools of thought on this important field, and it is written as a moderately engaging story. The writing style is a little bit cheesy, and some details are overly simplistic, but it serves its purpose as an introductory text to a very technical and difficult topic."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Indeed, considering artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly run our lives and that learning algorithms are the soul of AI, they are the order of the day.This is a beautifully written, rigorous, and all-encompassing account on the subject –  from privacy and ethical issues to the impact on medicine and all kinds of technologies – yet all in a light and accessible style, and with a great sense of humor.In brief, a most informative, enjoyable, and engaging book on a hot topic."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a tremendous work for people that want a good overview of the major theories behind machine learning but aren't necessarily looking to dive deep into the underlying math. The book has a very humorous tone, when appropriate, and creates numerous examples of machine learning and AI in practical use in industry. The book coincides with the free online course Pedro Domingos teaches at [...]Well done!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have not even finished reading this book but I felt the need to leave a review. It’s excellent. I have a CS degree and work in IT but have never really understood machine learning.  Pedro does a wonderful job of starting with the basics of ML in a way that anyone can understand. He then continues to build up to really complex topics while still keeping them understandable.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book (I read the Kindle edition) lives up to its many glowing reviews. It has to be difficult to write in a way so as to reach every potential reader on his or her level while introducing ML and AI concepts, but this is one book that accomplishes that. As others have pointed out, the author writes  engagingly and yet manages to explain some fairly technical concepts with a minimum of jargon or math. His enthusiasm for the topic is contagious. Highly recommended!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a brilliant overview of the current state of machine learning.  While it doesn't get into the details of coding or math, it's still not easy reading.

This book clearly explains the differences among the five principal branches of machine learning.  If you want to know, get this book and dig in."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"How-to guide for using machine learning to invest. Lots of different ideas. User must have intermediate knowledge of subject to get value out of book. It is a quick read, but I had to read every passage multiple times as their are a lot of unexplained assumptions in Prado's examples/anecdotes."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Marcos’ book is an excellent blueprint on how to structure a quantitative research operation for discovering and exploiting alpha sources. Mathematically and conceptually rigorous yet practical, it describes the building blocks needed for identifying market inefficiencies, constructing strategies, and evaluating their expected performance before live trading. At each step, it focuses pragmatically on the questions, challenges, and choices that the researcher faces in everyday work in the quest for alpha; it provides thoughtful solutions, many of which are the result of author's original research. This book is not intended as a description of specific strategies construction, which is the place where the researcher's experience and market intuition enters. Instead, it provides a rigorous and flexible framework that makes the research work possible and efficient. I suspect the book's contents can be fully appreciated by the experienced researcher. The junior quant may find it an invaluable resource in familiarizing himself/herself with key techniques. The institutional allocator may see it as a guide to how a successful quantitative investment operation might be structured, as well as to the pitfalls of taking shortcuts. There are few pragmatic machine learning finance books, and this definitely is one."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An excellent book - probably only book That introduces one to what’s really happening, not just the elegant theories. Dr Marcos Prado introduced every aspect of the subject beginning with the modern context why someone needs machine learning, how do you prepare the environment and data for ML algorithm, modeling, back testing and the latest trends and instruments in hand on HPC and Quantum Computing. The book highlighted the standard pitfalls and suggests what one should do in this cutting edge environment. Illustrations on using quantum algorithm is first found in this book. In many ways this book is very unique. It was my Best Buy in last few years. This book was suggested by an Economist and Financial Engineering expert Dr. Alo Ghosh."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Marcos has been a great mentor and instrumental in my understanding of Machine Learning as applied to Algorithmic Trading. He was more than willing to entertain all goofy and wild ideas I had such as using audio analysis on OHLC and secondary data to ""listen"" to the markets as well as other basic questions about his book ""Advances in Financial Machine Learning.""As with all things, good work takes time. Perfection is the enemy of progress and what an accomplishment and groundbreaking work his books has been to the industry to hear about a lot of these concepts for the very first time. Thinking about things like aggregation intervals and bar types with respect to time, tick, kase, volume, or other bar types as a different vantage point to trade on the same market but analyzing it with a fresh perspective.Overall, the book is a great tool and reference manual to further the understanding of Machine Learning and its applications into the Quantitative battlefields of Financial markets around the world. By sharing this industry knowledge to retail traders and the like certainly puts Dr. Prado at a strategic disadvantage as rest of us close the loop on all remaining alphas! However, I think in due time another book or installment delivered in content other than print might further elucidate the work of the Merlin behind the scenes.Somewhere in the distant future we all know that Quantum Computing would obviate trading altogether. Before such time, we can all rest assured that Dr. Prado is leading the charge into the Algorithmic fields to find what alphas are remaining in this highly competitive yet compelling field of study!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A fantastic addition to finance literature with must read chapters on backtesting pitfalls, hierarchical risk parity, deflated Sharpe ratios, explosiveness tests, entropy(complexity) estimators, and microstructural features.  You can and should read this book even with no knowledge of machine learning.  You will find it more useful if you have worked through the first four chapters of Aurelian Geron’s Hands-On Machine Learning.  No knowledge of fully connected neural networks, convolutional networks or recurrent networks is required.Dr de Prado works in the realm of systematic quantitative investing.  I think of this as trading rather than investing, where you expect to make a large number of decisions, each with a probability of success somewhat over 50%.  The comprehensive book Expected Returns by Antti Ilmanen explains how difficult it is to find systematic opportunities that last.  I suspect this applies to all quantitative strategies, including ones informed by machine learning, although we all would love to understand exactly how the folks at Renaissance Technologies construct and update their models.I think of investing as making a small number of decisions based on extensive due diligence, where you expect a high probability of success, much greater than 50%.  A private equity professional or an old fashioned stock picker like Warren Buffett makes at most a handful of investment decisions a year.  If they see a business with legs, one that will sustain growth of 20%+ per year trading a P/E of under 20, that business is unlikely to see much multiple compression and so is likely to yield 15% annual returns over the next 5 years.  Or they might anticipate similar returns from a mature business growing at 5% per year-  with no margin erosion - and 10% free cash flow yields.  These investors usually work best in teams due to the broad scope of their due diligence and also to achieve some diversification.  I do believe Dr de Prado’s ideas can be used to help inform some of these decisions but clearly we are dealing in the world of small numbers, even at the largest private equity groups and hedge funds.  Nevertheless, any young professional entering these fields would benefit by at least understanding how to work with data scientists who can help improve their decision making.I am inclined to agree with Dr de Prado that there are a lot of charlatans in the investing/trading world and it is not easy to figure out who they are.  This, taxes and the wonders of compounding in a low signal to noise world are what makes low cost passive investing the right choice for most people trying to build a nest egg for retirement."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With the advancements of computational processing and the improved cost in running such tasks, rigorous quantitative research via financial machine learning has entered our lives. In order to advance in this discipline, one needs a guide that brings together practical applications and academic investigation. This book is that guide, a bridge that crosses the chasm between academia and industry. Dr. López de Prado has achieved this daunting task in his exceptional, immersive book.This book aims to provide a healthy intuition to practitioners, academics, and future quants. As time is the scarcest resource, human computing and development have become the most expensive costs of transforming informative features into successful trading algorithms. In his book, the author explains that applied machine learning should be intuitive and a guided search. Machine learning should not just be solutions generated by intense computing power. The author emphasizes the importance of feature selection over back-testing. Simple and powerful concepts such as meta-labeling and the triple barrier method can be a breath of fresh air for many quants. In this journey, Dr. López de Prado guides the reader to avoid common pitfalls, introduces advances to simplify complicated concepts, and shares breakthrough solutions in financial machine learning, all in an engaging and witty narration.The depth and breadth of this book proves to be the pinnacle of Dr. López de Prado's decades-long work. References, exercises, code snippets, mathematical research, and a widespread bibliography create the ecosystem for many to learn from. This book will undoubtedly become a classic in this advancing field of financial machine learning."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is comprised of several research threads initiated by the author. It is an intellectually honest examination of the pitfalls of traditional econometric methods as well as those of ML approaches. The author is keenly aware of the low signal to noise ratios of typical financial time series and spends a lot of time developing methods that will distinguish true positives from the false ones, in particular the concept of a ""deflated"" Sharpe Ratio. A lot of ML strategies are prone to data-mining and fail to recognize the true number of parameters used in backtesting. The deflated Sharpe Ratio is an attempt to normalize a Sharpe Ratio after accounting for the true number of parameters involved in the data mining process.  This book strives to remain true to data and introduces several non-parametric methods that quants have been traditionally less exposed to. To name a few - information driven bars as opposed to standard bars, cross validation, bootstrap aggregation, bagging and boosting. Towards the end we also get a glimpse of techniques used to build high performing (out-of-sample) portfolio management strategies using clustering methods (Hierarchical Risk Parity). The book isn't exactly an easy read, but there is a wealth of Python code to help the reader follow the author's logic. I would highly recommend this book to any quant practitioner who is interested in applying ML techniques in finance."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Frankly, I'm amazed that this book even has 1-start reviews. Yes, it's very complicated. I'm a specialist in Machine Learning, Finance and Python and a professional programmer by trade before, though not a good mathematician. By now I read through it 16 times, no exaggeration, and I still keep finding new important nuances that I missed before.But come on, I've read through almost everything I can find on the topic. This book is by far the best and one of the only that actually discloses useful things regarding how to adapt our ML models to finance and how to avoid ruining mistakes.I and my team spend years building our own ML models and pipelines to predict financial markets. By now I like to believe that we understand at least something about how markets work. We've challenged every idea Marcos wrote in his book, and there is plenty. So far, we've managed to improve on 2 or 3 of them. Every other time it turned out that Marcos was looking far ahead into the future and considered things we didn't even know would be a problem.So, whatever the complexity of the book and the style it's written in. I'm giving it 5 stars and a huge thanks to Marcos for writing it. I already preordered the next one and eagerly waiting to give it a read, hoping that he managed to come up with more of the same amazing stuff he disclosed in Advances. That would be outstanding."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The explanations given in the book are all heuristic and failed to make points in so many ideas presented throughout the book. My view is that he might be a fine quant, but a terrible communicator and author.The Machine learning techniques employed here are very classic. None of the latest technique in the past few years is present. It's mostly classic quant financial mathematics.I liked the chapter one and the way he framed ML in quantitative finance. So I decided to buy. But the rest of  the book is almost unreadable.I also found bugs in the code. His code is not optimized and takes too much time to execute in some cases."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the biggest flaws in financial literature written by academics seems to be that it is so theoretical or essentially so overfitted that it is in unusable, while many books by former quants lean on the side of being practical, but usually too abstract from a justified reluctance to divulge anything close to trade secrets.This book gracefully walks this fine line, providing a highly pragmatic foundation to begin building a quantitative strategy, especially one that utilizes ML. Unlike other books or research papers that promise riches through the use of some newly developed ML algorithm, Dr. Lopez De Prado’s book is full of practical advice that will likely be ignored by many, to their peril, such as his strong insistence on accurately measuring overfit and carefully controlling the research process to minimize and avoid overfit.There are many other such hidden gems in the book, such as his own research, which is less theoretical but seems to be highly precise implementations of previously established concepts such as Markowitz Portfolio Optimization, the ADF test and others.Overall, this book is simply a must read for anyone pursuing quantitative trading. But reading it is not enough, thinking through the material and experimenting with it with incessant care is crucial in order to fully capture the experience and insight into the application of machine learning to financial markets that Dr. Lopez De Prado has to offer."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't pretend to have spent nearly as much time with this book as I've signed up to.  It arrived this afternoon, and it got at least 20 minutes of my time looking ahead at what Professor Abu-Mostafa is going to say to the world tomorrow.  But from page 15 to 27, here is what I can observe.A minor point:  I love the color examples within the book.  When I was in school, we didn't get textbooks like this.The tone of the text is very sympathetic in the direction of one who is interested in the subject.  That is, if you need to learn from data, the text considers what you will need to know to succeed.  The reader's need to understand is prioritized much higher than the reader's need to ""be educated"".Although I've been out of college for two decades, I have no problem following what the text has to say, or the direction it's headed in.  I don't abstract things magnificently, my calculus isn't that hot, and I slid through school without a probability class as such.  I love math, but I'm not a powerhouse at it compared to the peers who once sat next to me.  But I can follow this text, understand the exercises, and I conjecture that I can work the problems which are meant to be worked.For a non-academic, I have considerable on-the-ground machine learning background.  I've done a lot of backpropagation network training in my day in character recognition, acoustics, finance, and similar disciplines.  This is where I find the text valuable:  it can build on what I already know, and it starts in a place I'm already familiar with.  So if this is your field or one of your fields, the book will make not just a good textbook but a useful reference.So let's talk about what this book is not, and perhaps AMLbook will publish something else for us.  Don't expect a course in neural networks here.  They're not in the table of contents (""hmmm...""), but you'll find them in the index pointing you to the epilogue.  Support vector machines get the same treatment.  Now support vector machines are a little new for me; they came into their own after I finished college.  Neural networks, however, got an earlier start.What I can say is that this text is intentionally tool-neutral.  I just read 13 pages that weren't about neural networks per se, but they covered vital groundwork that I learned via hands-on experience with real neural networks.  My grasp of some of the ""why"" components of what I know is already improved.I am not in love with whatever chemical processes went into the manufacture of this book.  Perhaps it came off the press so recently that I'm noticing that, and the effects will fade.  For right now, it's a definite don't-cuddle-with volume which drives me to the bathroom sink when I put it down.  I can live with this; it's a small price to pay for the knowledge.The amount I paid for this text was astonishingly low.  No doubt the authors have thought this through carefully, but this text will hold its own against others that cost three to six times what I paid.I apologize if this is not the best-informed review.  I'm hitting send a little early, because at the present time, you don't have many alternatives to read."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning From Data is a book on learning theory and few learning algorithms. The book also describes the different methodologies used to evaluate models. In my opinion, this book is not suitable for beginners as it delves into abstract notions that may not be relevant for people who are just coming into the field. I think that this book is for people who already had exposure to machine learning and who are willing to take their understanding to the next step.In conclusion; if you are a newbie avoid this book, otherwise if you already had exposure to machine learning it's a good resource to understand machine learning theory in more depth."

It also provides the next steps for people to learn and explore machine learning on their own-it looks fun!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A word of warning: I'm not a machine learning practitioner and not even mathematically inclined. I am merely an average person with a (reasonable) degree of culture (I suppose I classify as a sociologist) looking out to understand the world around me a little better.Yet I loved this book, it opened my eyes on a world I suspected existed somewhere in the depths of my computer or when I did a Google search but that I never understood. If you are afraid to be engulfed in equations, don't be. The author prefers to use allegories and is very good at giving simple explanations, making everything (almost) crystal clear.What you get is a comprehensive overview of where machine learning is going. This is hugely important, considering the sometimes disturbing news you get in the media - not just from Snowden but also from ""neurotechnologists"" who guide political campaigns by embedding cameras in ads, cameras that detect the viewers' reactions and then adjust the campaign in function of these reactions.Perhaps my only quarrel with this book - but it does not detract from its excellence and the five stars I gave it - is the philosophical position taken by the author. I don't quite share his optimism about our robotic future. And this for 2 reasons:One, the connection between learning algorithms and data. Domingos does note at the outset: ""...the more data they [the learners] have, the more intricate the algorithms can be."" So without ""big data"", you don't get ""good"" learning algorithms - the ""bigger"" the data, the better the algorithm. Or as Domingos writes, ""the more data we have, the more we can learn"". True enough. But what about the quality and size of the big data? What if the data is error-filled and we're not aware of it? Can machine learning be aware of something their human masters are not? On what basis? The algorithms are taught to deal with an imperfect world and draw the most likely conclusions, where ""most likely"" is highly subjective. Or at least, it is ""highly subjective"" in my opinion and I realize that it is only one opinion and not necessarily one shared by the author.Two, the connection between you as you are and an expanded ""digital you"": a ""model"" of who you are, your work experience, your tastes, a model that the algorithm has learned - and thanks to algorithms, you will be able to do more things and faster than ever before. Domingos describes an extraordinary future where, for example, in your LinkedIn account, ""you'll immediately interview for every job in the universe that remotely fits your parameters (profession, location, pay, etc) LinkedIn will respond on the spot with a ranked list of the best prospects, and out of those, you'll pick the first company that you want to have a chat with. Same with dating: your model will go on millions of dates so you don't have to...""Big time-saver obviously. But it comes at a cost: you have to give your parameters (stuff about your work, your likes and dislikes) to the algorithms. Ye who go digital, leave behind any notion of privacy...So users of this algorithmic landscape will have few shaded areas in which to hide.But for me, privacy concerns aside (and I'm not that concerned, I have nothing to hide), there is yet another matter that I find more worrisome. Domingos (on p.283) tells us he is confident that the future can only get better: ""In fact, it's the systems that have a slight edge in serving us better that will, generation after generation, multiply and take over the gene pool."" Then he adds: ""Of course, if we're so foolish as to deliberately program a computer to put itself above us, then maybe we'll get what we deserve"".Indeed. That is precisely my worry: can we be sure that there won't be a Doctor Evil who will do so? Can we be sure that there won't be an Apprentice Sorcerer who might end up doing this even if unintentionally? A mistake can happen...So yes, I'm deeply worried about this algorithmic future and I don't share the author's unflagging optimism. But that doesn't mean it's a book you shouldn't read. On the contrary, it's a must read precisely because it raises all these fundamental questions about the future of humanity. And it is an easy read even for the non-cognoscenti like myself, I highly recommend the introductory chapters, and if you get bogged down in the middle with all the technicalities, no fear, skip to the last two chapters, they are well worth reading!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really weird book, in between a scientific journal , science fiction and programming course.A little bit hard to follow the writer's thoughts from time to time, the way the sentences are structured is super dense and convoluted.Overall, a perfect intro to machine learning, would recommend."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,I respectfully disagree with reviewers who say this book makes the topic easy to understand. The explanations for how each of the major machine learning algorithms work were very difficult for me to follow. They got very technical and I feel like you need at least an undergraduate level math degree to understand what he's saying about probabilities and inference trees. Either that or I'm dumber than other reviewers.

In the end you understand the 5 master algorithms and how they, one time, will work together towards the Master Algorithm.

,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave up reading this book at chapter 3 because of the terrible, uneven writing that is indicative of an author or book editor that doesn't care about organizing concepts in a way that is accessible.  It is clear that the author is very knowledgeable, but a very poor communicator.  The book gets of on the wrong foot (in my opinion) with a lot of useless fluffy tropes in chapter 1 about the how AI can transform business and livelihoods, then poses interesting questions in chapter 2 and I got encouraged for a while.  Chapter 3 then turns into an almost flow of consciousness discussion of induction using an example of finding dates / match-making that resembles an intellectual diarrheal discourse.This is when I gave up in frustration.  I have a bachelors and masters in computer science (with a focus on artificial intelligence in the latter) and a PhD in ecology, have been following developments in AI as an interested layman with good foundational knowledge, and was hoping to get a little more in-depth idea of what's going on, but this book is totally useless in that regard.  I have bad books on my Kindle book-shelf, but never felt so compelled to write in irritation about a lousy read."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Advances in Financial Machine Learning"" book by dr. Marcos Lopez de Prado is the first book known by me dedicated to this topic written by a  professional and practicioner with many years of experience in real money management. The book is focused on potential pitfalls or over optimistic approaches and how to properly handle them. I fully agree with his approach - with the high computing power available in the Cloud on request, it is very easy to overfit investing strategies and find something which works on past data. Dr. de Prado provides very pragmatic, but also scientifically - backed, approach on  how to handle these situation and properly calculate the real results for a given strategy. Most of the scientific papers and books in this area are focused on machine learning approaches, algorithms and methods. They put less attention to the proper statistical approaches to measure the results. In the book by dr. de Prado the presented machine learning methods  are rather simple, but provided with the complete set of scientific proofs and reasoning. It creates the real value of his work. I recommend this book very much to all investment practitioners, not only in the machine  learning fields but also for the algo/hft trading. And I have also found very interesting and inspiring all other available papers by dr. de Prado.Paweł Skrzypek - AI Investments CTO"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are many famous books that teach you Machine Learning,  Econometrics, Quant Finance. While all these books are good, they often concentrate on the single subject instead of a combination of those. Many of us might be good at Quant Finance or only Machine Learning, but we often find it troubling to connect the bridge between the two worlds. Lopez de Prado's book is a synergy of both Quant Finance and ML in this way.  The book teaches the right way to apply machine learning in finance and covers a lot of applications related to asset allocation, high-frequency finance, Quant Trading etc.The book is divided into 5 parts with each part building up to a more advanced material.  Part one discusses different kinds of financial data and how to use them for analysis and training purposes. Part two discusses modeling covering important algorithms, their merits, and demerits when applied to financial data. Part three concentrates on the dangers of Backtesting in today's practice, and the right way to conduct backtesting, and interpret the backtest statistics as its really important that ML models don't suffer from data mining.  My favorite one in this part was the Machine Learning Asset Allocation chapter which solves the minimum variance problem compared to Markowitz's or Risk Parity methods. Part four discusses various advanced applications related to Quant Trading, Portfolio construction, Market Microstructure. Part five is not for the faint-hearted as it teaches various advanced computer science techniques to speed up the performance ML algorithms in practice.Overall, the book lets you change the way that one traditionally thinks about financial data and ML applications on it.  I'd recommend this book to any aspiring quant working/wants to work in ML quant research. To the people who already purchased, The best way to use the book is to try out the algorithms yourself (All the Python code is on Lopez de Prado's website) and study its applications and results."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've read almost all the text. I quickly scanned some parts.I'll give it 5 because I like the content and applied some techniques in my work.Compared to other books in the market, this is the one with most advanced topics.What could be better:1. Definitely colorful figures needed because most of the the time it is hard to differentiate shades of gray.2. Code snippets could be available as a flash disk or CD or online. They should not reside in the book. Wastes too much places. Hard to read without coloring of modern IDEs. Copying them to computer would require work.3. Some figures are unnecessary. You can get the main idea in a few figures.4. More drawings instead of math to explain anything. Not everyone should spend time to understand notations, the math and the proofs.I'll read it again and may share more."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a fresh graduate with some experience in ML and Finance, I found this book to be extremely helpful.A decent Math and ML background is all you need to understand the bleeding edge concepts introduced by Marcos.Marcos has wrote some great breakthrough papers and this book gives a good insight to many of his works.I highly recommend this book to both fresh graduates interested in or entering the asset management industry as well as seasoned professionals. This book introduces you to a new paradigm of finance that has not been documented with such great detail before.The best thing I like about this book is that Marcos unselfishly introduces some of the least documented cutting edge concepts in finance that will improve on even the seemingly latest ideas (he makes traditional risk parity which came to popularity in the last decade look old).Marcos covers a lot of breadth in his book – techniques related to data organization, signal research, strategy allocation and improvement. And these techniques can be applied to a broad range of trading strategies from high frequency signals to slower factor based signals."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently I bought Advances in Financial Machine Learning, and it's an amazing work. Working in finance myself, where I head the research program in our company, this book is going to be required reading for anyone even contemplating the development of a quantitative investment strategy. I got very interested in machine learning some 18 months ago. One of the things that drew me to this field, is not so much what you could predict with these techniques, but that it forces you to build a theoretical and statistical framework, that can be used by a machine learning algorithm to assess, and  learn from data in a systematic, and scientifically sound manner. This book goes a long way in explaining why this is so important, whilst also offering a host of techniques, and theory for successfully applying machine learning in finance."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"“One day in the near future, Machine Learning will dominate finance, science will curtail guessing, and investing will not mean gambling.” Machine learning is the future of the financial industry and after years of trading and operations experience I learned one thing: you must learn to accept change and adapt quickly. Being new to the field, I was initially hesitant to commit to a 400 page book about financial machine learning. However, nothing in this book is intimidating. Marcos does an excellent job relating each topic to real-life situations. He dissects a complex subject that enables a beginner like myself to understand the material while keeping it appealing to the highest skill level. It’s hard to accomplish that but Marcos did it with perfection and it’s what separates the good books from the great. I highly recommend this book to readers with all skill levels from novices just skimming the surface to professionals with years of machine learning experience."

You can dip into it almost anywhere and find something useful, even though the presentation is supposed to be sequential.What you get from this book will depend a lot on what you bring to it. López de Prado is quite direct in identifying his ""Target Audience"", and it helps to have prior knowledge of machine learning and the financial problems it's being applied to.It's impossible for practitioners to strike the right note with every reader. Too much detail for some. Not enough for others. Against this, however, is the value of knowing what a very skilled practitioner finds valuable, and this is something that López de Prado provides in spades."

Topics covered are pact with information, and most likely there will be a need to go back and reread a few chapters, but one can never have too much of intellectual stimulation! The book bridges the gap between ML and finance, and the author points out many pitfalls to current applications of ML in investment management, and provides alternative solutions. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a passionate learner and wants to bring innovation to currently saturated field of quantitative finance."

Part 3 (Backtesting) was most useful for me, specifically Chapters 10 (Sizing) and 11 (Backtesting red flags) were practical and well thought out. The code snippets throughout the book are very helpful.  The final section, Part 5 - HP computing gave me something to shoot for - i.e. learning goals.  Lastly, the references throughout the book are GREAT (see pages 20, 149, 158-160, at least those were most useful for myself). Seems like the one star reviews are non specific, and likely a product of the authors not understanding the material."

It moves into higher mathematics and lesser Code.Seems the author would benefit from reading a timeless classic “Code Complete” by Steve McConnell."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a practitioner who has spent many years developing investment and trading strategies, I believe this book is destined to be a classic in the financial literature, and arguably the most important landmark since Fama's ""Foundations in Finance"" and Markowitz's portfolio analysis. Addressed to an audience knowledgeable of both finance and machine learning, this book should nonetheless be read by quants without ML background since it provides guidance on the thorniest issues in the design of quantitative investment strategies.Here are, inter alia, some of the topics that are critical to quantitative investment development, but which are not satisfactorily addressed elsewhere: (1) feature extraction for financial time series, (2) variable horizon analysis and trade sizing, (3) modified bootstrapping methods for financial time series, (4) corrected cross-validation for time series, (5) avoiding the statistical malpractice of naive backtesting, (6) machine learning for asset allocation, (7) structural break tests, and (8) entropy features.Many ML skeptics are wary of black box models in general, and in particular will discount de Prado's approach.  To them I would counsel rethinking the paradigm of classical statistics, that models with only a few parameters are invariably overfit. The ML revolution is teaching us that this paradigm is false, that the natural world and the human participants in it have such regular behavior, that models with thousands of parameters designed along the lines of human perceptual and cognitive systems can be accurately fit --- and not overfit!!A must-have addition to any serious quantitative analyst's bookshelf."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The book accompanies Caltech's online course of the same name https://telecourse.caltech.edu/index.phpPretty much in line with the online lectures. The course covers machine learning in general and focuses on the theory of learning with introductory material on various learning algorithms incorporated into the chapters as they become relevant. I'm giving this 4 stars because it is indeed a short course on learning from data as the cover says. This is not an in-depth book on learning algorithms although it does of course cover some of these in reasonable depth but always from a computer science angle towards the theory of learning rather than in a practical applied 'engineering' light. The book and the online course itself is actually of very high quality (despite being free); the professor's lectures are very well structured, organised and explained. Finally, the price is OK but a little high given its total knowledge content - although addmitedly I am maybe a little miserly :)"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is a regular book.
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It seems very hands off, very theoretical. This must be a good textbook for class but not something you'd have with you on your journey as a reference."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is a lot more about theory than application. It also involves heavy math. I purchased this because I was generally interested in Machine Learning, and it was ranked highly. However, it was a disappointment because I want to be a _user_ of machine learning, not a researcher of the topic."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Data analysis
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a nice introduction to the subject of machine learning. Even if is highly opinionated (and I did not formed my opinion yet) it still provides plenty of references and is an excellent introduction at different level of technical know-how.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The author has a fun, expansive and exciting personality, making this book incredibly enjoyable and insightful to read!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A very good book on AI for non-dummies. Forget the ""master algorithm"". This book's real value is in its thorough introduction to contemporary AI."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,this book deserves its 5 star rating because it gave me a comprehensive view of this subject. the majority of books on ML tend to focus on thge individual algorithms rather than the big picture.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the opportunity to read this book as soon as it got out. I an very glad that I did it since it allowed me to confirm some methods that I was working with and help me see some areas that I have not been paying attention to.One phrase that I can really relate to and want the reader to take into account: ""You want a systematic trading algorithm factory, not just one, but a factory"".The only way to tackle good research is to stablish a method to it and this book provide you with the mindset to it.In particular, I really appreciate the code showed in the book and seeing it from a financial perspective helps a lot getting the idea of what he is talking about.The generalization of the code, could be achieved by one or two tweeks, but as expected, no one will reveal the real meat, but can provide a direction to it.PS: I also have the opportunity to meet him in a conference and was pleased by the way he presents a good technical concept to grasp the beauty of it.If you are somewhat near a FO role or are related to the Asset Management, or Systematic Trading bussiness this is a must have book!Now, if you combine it with the Carver books you will have the architecture and the modules.What else do you need?Learn and Enjoy,Vic"
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not sure who this book would be useful for, tbh. Beginners certainly wouldn't make use of the code. It's as useful for ML in Finance as ""Trading Natural Gas"" is to the nat gas market. Basically you can get a high level overview but the chance it applies directly to what you do is very slim. Who here is going to read this book then start up a so called algo-strategy-making factory? Any seasoned quant would know this stuff from online research.  First 20 pages are worth the read though."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Helped me put the subject into a broad perspective seeing how different aspects relate to each other. For non experts it's worth it to read sections more than once to improve understanding. Well written and a strong contribution.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book for the right reader
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"One if the best books I have ever read about ML... comprehensive work but I felt a bit too lengthy the explanations. I think a more condensed, more consised version would have been even more useful."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent overview of AI for non-professionals. The most amazing thing for me is the fact that AI has its roots and applications in a variety of disciplines, and this book successfully weaved all of them together. Analogies, Fun facts, key insights, this book has plenty of ways to keep me engaged."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having worked both as a quant at a hedge fund and in data science at a tech startup, the lack of penetration of modern data science and machine learning techniques into everyday quantitative finance has long surprised me. Cross-validation, feature importance, and random forests are commonplace outside of quantitative finance, yet rarely mentioned inside. This is not to say that there are no hurdles that prevent the adoption of these ideas – the non-stationary time series that are common in finance are challenging data sets. What has been needed is someone to address these challenges and bridge the gap between quantitative finance and data science/machine learning.Dr. Marcos López de Prado does a fantastic job of doing just that in Advances in Financial Machine Learning. He provides a detailed description how to turn machine learning and data science theory into practice. The chapters are clear, concise, and full of useful references. Dr. López de Prado goes so far as to include snippets of Python code illustrating exactly his methods. This is no small matter – many quants use the gap between the theory in their papers and the art of putting their theory into practice in order to create a veil of uncertainty that can obscure a lack of robustness or reproducibility in their results. In contrast, Dr. López de Prado seems to invite his readers to use his techniques directly via his code snippets.In addition to the most direct applications of data science and machine learning into quantitative finance, Dr. López de Prado goes in depth on more advanced topics such as creating more rigorous and predictive trading strategies, detecting regime shifts, and breathing new life into risk parity. For any quant looking to move beyond the well-tread techniques of OLS regression, independent and identically distributed random variables, and efficient frontiers into the methods of modern data science and machine learning, Advances in Financial Machine Learning is a must-read."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Marcos has set the stage for a systematic way to labeling meta data and microstructure for machine learning and HPC. This is one of the most critical steps in deciphering the integrity of the data sample and detecting false positives or negatives,which are also invaluable for accuracy of classifiers in predictive analytics. Given my role in business development for AI and deep learning,  I find the use cases and optimization techniques shown here are a great way to validate the foundation of Marcos's approach towards data analytics. I recommend this book as a must-read for anyone interested in the new frontier of machine learning in finance."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"López de Prado covers a large number of current topics in finance. He strikes a good balance between theory and real-world analysis, making it a good summary work for the practitioner. He also includes helpful python snippets. Of course, as a practitioner, I always wish to see more coded examples.If you decide not to read this book, I highly recommend you read his list of why ML projects fail. You can find them on the web. From personal experience, I can confirm their truth."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,The book gives a summary of the field. The reference at the end of the chapter is a good guide for original papers. One main problem is that the mathematical symbols in the book are all over the place and could be confusing. I did phD in math but in many places it takes me quite a bit of efforts to figure out what the author really means. Hiding behind these inconsistent symbols might give the impression of accuracy but in reality it lowers the standard and does a disservice to serious readers. Either fix those symbols or drop them completely and replace with simple illustrations or examples should be more than sufficient for the next version - if there is one. The ideas are not complicated anyway.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Marcos book is one of the rare gems you find once or twice a year in the overcrowded publication of financial books. His deep academic knowledge of ML combined with top notch experience in Finance, allowed him to deliver a publication that is outstanding in its level of depth, breadth, accuracy and attention to details whose importance are well know to people who actually engage with the market on a daily basis.If you really want to acquire the state of the art knowledge of ML applied to finance, this book is an absolute must."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is exceptionally well-written.  It brings to light the many real-world, in the trenches,  challenges of applying machine learning to finance.  Dr. Prado's writing style is quite engaging and left me with many treasures lifted from the often detailed explanations.  Many books are full of academic and theoretical approaches, which often fail in real markets.  This book sheds great light on an end-to-end approach in the financial ML world,  a discussion in and of itself which is invaluable.  I highly recommend this book to all seeking clarity in ML in finance,  and assure you that you will not be disappointed."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a hedge fund manager, I really enjoyed this book -- and not only for the 'machine learning' aspects of it... There are many smaller takeaways along the way that can be applied more broadly (e.g. data transformations such as fractional differentiation; or how to detect changes in liquidity from the high-low timeseries) that could be applied outside of a machine learning context. So many insights in this book, it should be of interest to a very broad set of traders!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A great book on ML techniques for financial markets. While the book does not take a cookbook approach to specific ML methods, it has a great treatment on creating structures that are well suited for ML. When it comes to back testing, it is perhaps the best book I've read on the topic; Addresses various approaches, pitfalls, and ways to avoid these. Detecting regime shifts, and deflating sharpe ratios are readily implementable. Overall treatment is titled towards time-series modeling. Rather than glancing through the book, spend time to read in detail, and deploy code snippets. All in all, a fantastic book for a HF practitioner.Arun"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I find this book to be a very useful collection of important tricks in one place that is very hard to find anywhere else. It also contains references to many other sources of important information.However, it is not a book for beginners, there are many other books that will teach you basics of Python,  machine learning, data science and quantitative finance, which you need to know to understand this book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Whether you are a discretionary fund manager interested in building out a quantitative strategy division, or a technologist looking to break into finance, Dr. Lopez de Prado's book cuts through the hype, pinpoints, and succinctly identifies what really matters.

,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is an interesting book but I found that it's hard to use it in reality for actual trading of securities. A newly published book   Forecasting and Timing Markets: A Quantitative Approach           is more practical for retail and professional investors.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Marcos gives a rigorous rundown on the use of practical machine learning in finance that you can NOT find in any other book. Obviously you're going to buy the book, so just do it.Check out the python package mlfinlab to see some of the implementations of the code.Also, I can't wait for the new book later this year! Thanks for the knowledge Marcos!!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book.  Covers a lot of approaches that you probably wouldn't have thought of just starting out.  You really have to read sections a few times to understand not only what he's doing but why.  My only gripe is that the code snipets are kind of useless in that you often don't know the format of the arguments into the functions.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the interesting things about this book is that he goes into detail about why traditional ML methods can fail when applied to financial markets. For example, traditional backtesting techniques can be problematic. He explains why this is the case and how to address it."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a must read for those interested in really getting a good grisp on the topic, not just get acquainted to. The parallel with the theory of everything is worth mentioning."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm giving this book 4 starts because it was entertaining read (especially the last chapter), and and because I found a few neat nuggets of knowledge about the connections between various Machine Learning concepts.My issues with this book are:1. It is not clear who the target audience is. It seems like this book is written for everyone and no one. As someone with a background in Machine Learning I would have preferred a few succinct formulas over paragraphs of explanation. For someone without any background in ML on the other hand the explanations won't make a lot of sense - they are full of technical jargon.2. The book is clearly biased towards the author's own point of view and work. Of course that's unavoidable when you're writing a book, but you should at least let your readers know about it. The book is written/marketed as if it represents hard truths, not personal opinions.3. For the topics I was intimately familiar with I found that the authors skims of a lot details and/or doesn't consider developments that address the problems he describes. I also found a few minor mistakes (no major ones). This makes me very skeptical about the sections on topics I am NOT familiar with, which are probably of similar depth."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As an undergraduate researcher in Machine Learning, this book was quite the eye-opener. I'd say that for starters, if you're expecting this book to provide you with a sense of technical understanding on the vast scope of topics covered within, you're misinterpreting the intention. Rather, Pedro Domingos takes you on a journey throughout the history surrounding attempts at cracking the master algorithm. He presents useful and concise interpretations of the different learning tribes (Connectionists, Symbolists, etc.); noting their respective successes and failures. More notably, he concocts his own attempt at the master algorithm, an effort that by no means could be described anything less than luminary. That's the essence of this book in my eyes, to serve as an approachable starting point to understand the fundamentals surrounding a universal learner, and how not to repeat the transgressions of our past so as to eventually instantiate progress."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,The author definitely knows the topic but I find it too long for what it has to convey. Other books cover the topics better. It might be fine as your first book on AI and ML.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this book.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great read if one understands and AGREES that future employment to managing almost every daily activity will entail software + data = analytics.  Learning (defined as exploration (trial and error) plus exploitation (working out the bugs to be most efficient) is too slow or alternatively, a race to knowledge (which is the history of mankind primarily via weapons and/or farming) will be directly dependent upon software / machine learning.  The term ""knowledge learners"" will replace ""knowledge engineers"" when machines (via self learning) is achieved.  And hence, this publication.

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"A modest number of topics in a handbook for a specific purpose: equities trading. Is any of it still relevant? Who knows? This is not a deep dive into the science of machine learning methods. A somewhat experienced practitioner with quantitative background is unlikely to find insights of lasting value. This book could be better in a shorter, pithier form. A chapter on physics applications thrown in the end is definitely not for physicists."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book covers important topics in alpha research in general, beyond Machine Learning techniques. However, the technical solutions provided on these topics are not so exciting nor original as claimed."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The ideas and techniques in this book are invaluable not just to finance but to time series data in general. Make sure you have a solid foundation in machine learning before reading this book (try Bishop).
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a practitioner more familiar with traditional techniques in Finance, Advances in Financial and Machine Learning served as a useful and practical summary of the various ways that Machine Learning can be used to tackle problems in Finance. I think this book will also be helpful to people familiar with Machine Learning who are not familiar with Finance. Although I have not worked through all the examples, there is a good mix of theory (motivation), code, and results, along with suggestions for additional research. I greatly appreciate the author's practical experience at scale, and his academic rigor."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book helped me reorganize raw trade data into a structured data set for generating features and finding false positives.  I adopted its labeling methods and improved some old supervised models.  I recommend having a strong python programming background with machine learning experience before buying this book.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great book, the best thing is that it is different. It's a book about Machine Learning that you can read as a novel and the most interesting thing is that you will learn something.Instead of the boring academic formulas-explanation-examples template Pedro uses a very smart narrative to introduce the reader to the different tribes of Machine Learning, there's a very solid description of how the most important ML algorithms work and while the book is intended for beginners it is full of very interesting tidbits that will be appreciated even for experts in the field.There's no unnecessary decoration, no description of skynet or machines taking over the world because that's not what the book is about.The idea of the Master Algorithm is interesting, the way the author tries to lead towards his favorite toys is not solid and is probably the weakest part of the book but we can forgive him because who doesn't like his own research?I think this is a book were you will find many interesting quotes, stories and references, after reading it I kept coming back to some chapters just because I liked how they were written.There's a lot to learn about this book, specially about how to present ML algorithms to students or the general public."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did not expect an APPLIED machine learning book from an AI researcher. I’m glad I was wrong.The author keeps the academics to a minimum and focuses on applied machine learning.Many authors ‘hide’ their lack of knowledge with mathematical formulas. Not so in this book. Being able to explain complex topics with words + images requires a profound knowledge.- (page 12): Don’t believe the short-term hype. Excellent part of the introduction.- (page 19): You only need two tools to be successful on Kaggle. I heard people being criticized for being too focused – Francois is willing to stand up. Kudos.- (page 31): 0D tensors, 1D tensors, 2D tensors …what are they exactly?- (page 184): word vectors vs. word embeddings explained nicely on two pages only.- (page 188): training word embeddings in Keras – I’m not so sure about it…- (page 225): NLP with 1D convnets.

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a CS professor, and I chose this for my course in Deep Learning last term.  Overall I am happy with the book, and will use it again.  It rates 5 (or even 6!) stars for being an approachable introduction to Deep Learning, using the author's excellent Keras library to allow beginners to do remarkable work.  My own class of undergrads was building DLNN models to do sophisticated image recognition tasks after just a few weeks.So, why the four stars?  Because the book is rather ""paint by the numbers"". The presentation is filled with ""Now you'll do this.."" followed by working blocks of code for the student to enter and run.  But there are no exercises, code or mathematical.  Even the standard backpropagation algorithm is only qualitatively described -- nice pictures of gradient descent in 2 dimensions, but no hard equations.  (After all, Keras does it all for you, right?)  And as the book ventures into more advanced areas like GANs, VAEs, etc the presentation is increasingly high-level and nonmathematical, providing only a feel for the topics without deep comprehension.  Given the depth of the math involved, I suppose I can't blame Chollet for a bit of handwaving.  But more rigor with deeper explanations would have been nice."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm using this as the primary textbook for a Deep Learning course I'm designing right now for the University of Washington professional/continuing education program. I'll also assign readings from the Goodfellow et al. text, but Chollet's book is a more practical way to get started. He is also the author of the Keras framework; it's great to get advice ""straight from the horse's mouth"".Overall this book is more about practical techniques and python code (in Keras) than about deep learning math/theory. This is probably what the majority of readers are looking for. It's a great synthesis of the most important techniques now (start of 2018), which is hard to get just from reading papers.I would recommend complementing this book with two others:1) as mentioned above:   Deep Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)          2)   Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems"

,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  I have Geron's book on machine learning which is good but I was looking for an explanation of what is under the covers behind the python functions in tensorflow.  Chollet, the author of this book, provides an excellent tutorial on the basics.  He breaks down complex algorithms involving tensors to the many underlying simple calculations.  I like the way he uses python notation to explain the mathematical constructs and operations rather than subscript indices found in most books.  Explanations are aided by effective conceptual diagrams.  I also like the way he advises when sections can be skipped if the reader has familiarity with specific topics.  I find the writing highly readable."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After completing deeplearning.ai courses on coursera.com, I purchased this book to gain a better understanding of Keras.  Keras was used in the courses, but wasn't explained so well.  The author provides that explanation but also adds his perspective on neural networks and valuable insights and historical context.  I don't think you get a depth of understanding for neural networks from the book.  But if you already explored the field of deep learning, this is a great book to help take your exploration to the next level.  I am able to use Keras more effectively to quickly try different architectures.  It's great book and worth the spend."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,日本のレビューを見ると星が少ないレビューもありますが、amazon.comで見ると平均4.7とかなり良い評価をもらっています。とは言え、先輩たちの貴重なご意見を参考にしてKindle版ではなく書籍版を購入しました。実際に手を動かしながら読んだ感想から言うと、これまで読んだ日本語の書籍を含む機械学習関連の本の中では最も良かったです。最近読んだ「Pythonではじめる機械学習」もかなり好きな本なのですが、こちらの本は最初の章で機械学習の概要をさらっと説明していたり、機械学習のプロジェクトのステップはこうだよね、というむしろ仕事で機械学習を使いたいと思っている人に対する配慮も見えて良かったです。(「Pythonではじめる〜」は、プロダクトマネージャの方が書いているので、仕方ないですがscikit-learnの中に閉じてしまっている感じがします。)英語と言うことで尻込みする人もいるかも知れませんが、比較的平易な英語で書かれており、分からない用語が出てきたらググれば良いだけの話だと思います。特に前半は、数学的な説明もかなり丁寧で、数学は高校までだった自分でも割とすんなり入っていけました。Githubのレポジトリを見ると本文では書いてないけど、実は知りたいことがさらっと書いてあったり、手を動かしながらやると結構得した気分になります。(そこまで本に書いちゃうと本文の焦点がぼけたり、書籍化のためのお値段が上がるのでは？)年末に良い本を引き当てたなぁと素直に思えます。
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been studying AI on and off for over 25 years, and have worked on statistical modelling for the past 20 years, including at Caltech and in Wall Street. I am currently running a summer program on Machine Learning in finance at UCL and am writing positions papers on ML, AI and big data. I own a library of Mathematical Statistics, Modelling, AI, Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, Python, R, etc books and I have to say that this book makes all the others redundant. This is like Wilmott/Hull is for finance, or Kernigen & Ritchie for C.This is so obviously written by a practitioner - someone who has done it and has the scars to show it. Even the title tells you this is for the grown-ups - forget R and all that crap, all roads lead to SKLearn and TensorFlow, via anaconda a Jupyter.Buy this book and ""Elements of Statistical Learning"" and you have all the library you ever need. If you don't want to get bogged down in the maths, then just buy this one."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have taken the machine learning class in Coursera but the first two chapters in this book brough a whole new level of clarity to all the concepts. I finally really get what each of the parts of the training and optimization do. Also love the explanations in code instead of in mathematics. I feel I have a much better intuition about vectors than I did before.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought 10 books on ML/DL, and of those this is the 9th book that I have read (actually I have just started reading this book, but it's been so good thus far that I wanted to write a review.) As another reviewer noted, one should read other books on ML/DI to get a deeper understanding of the topic. This book explains using programs instead of using much mathematics. The advantage that I have had is my review of the same topics from other perspectives in books such as the followingIntro to statistical learning (by Hastie et al)Intro to Machine Learning (by Alpaydin)Deep Learning (by Goodfellow, Bengio etc)Hands-on ML w SciKit, Keras and Tensorflow (by Geron)When I first tried to read this book by Chollet in early April I was not as conversant with Python, and so I took a break and decided to brush up my limited Python knowledge by going through the first 6 chapters of ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" (by Sweigert). Now that I have more knowledge of Python this book by Chollet is so much more comprehensible. As I said I have the advantage of having learned many of these concepts earlier. I love Chollet's interpretation and explanations. I wish I could do the exercises but am having difficulty setting up the GPU machine.The problem I am dealing with with this book by Chollet is the setup of a GPU machine in the Amazon Cloud. If anyone can help me that would be greatly appreciated (I understand that this is not the forum to seek technical help on AWS, but I thought I'd give it a try)"
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this book for a class and unfortunately didn't realize that it was missing pages until 1 month before the semester has ended (i.e. 3 months after buying the book).  In Chapter 7 (Advanced Deep Learning Best Practices), this book has blank pages for p. 234-35, 238-39, 242-43 -- 6 pages!!  There is also a wonderful advertisement from the publisher that you can get this book as a free e-book and there are supposed to be codes throughout the book that you can put in to get access. THERE ARE NO CODES ON ANY PAGES!!!  I was hoping to access the free PDF version so that I can view the information on the missing pages but I can't get access to it because the printing issues include a failure to print the codes!!"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was already familiar with deep learning for image and sequence problems.  But this is the book I wish I had started out with.  Good coverage of techniques and concepts, practical, well-explained, with lots of source code.  And Keras is a pretty nice framework for prototyping (I prefer PyTorch).I recommend this book 100% to any student or practitioner of deep learning.However, 20 pages in the middle of my book were faint and very hard to read - an obvious printing error.  My copy is the first printing, purchased in Summer 2018.Also there is some weirdness with the layout; many (many!) words are hyphenated when they don't need to be, such as in the middle of a sentence.  Minor nit that they will hopefully fix in the next printing."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is a great hands-on introduction to Keras.  If you expected a Deep Learning (graduate-level) textbook, however, you've come to the wrong place.  This is not it.  If, at the other hand, you're looking for a crash course on Keras that gets you up-and-running in record time without going to too much mathematical overhead, you probably couldn't do much better.So why only 4 stars? Craftsmanship!  The text has been obviously previously formatted differently, and now there are hyphenated  word-breaks in the middle of the lines all over the place - doesn't help a professional look from a publisher's point of view.  Then, nobody caught Chollet's occasional slips when he attributes human sentiments to networks (networks ""prefer""... etc) - not overly professional from a scientific point of view.  Then some plots are mislabeled (""Loss"" instead of ""Accuracy"").  All little things, but one can do better.Overall, I would (and have!) recommend this book to a friend to get started with Keras."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The content is generally great. However, some of the libraries the author uses are no longer under development (Theano, python-opencv). Keras has been moved to tensorflow and is no longer a separate library. OpenCV is a pip library and shouldn't be installed with apt. The author's coding style is pretty also bad and hard to read. For example, you shouldn't read a CSV file with 400k rows by creating an empty array, read each line as a string, splitting them on the delimiter, then iterating over each row in the array. That's bad."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just finished the first three chapters of this book and you can really feel the enthusiasm of the author. He put so much effort in making the book comprehensible. For example, he doesn't use math equations to explain the theory of neural network but turn to Python code instead. It proves way easier to understand for me, someone working in industry for years. He begins by going straight into our first neural network, stating that ""we have to start somewhere"", which is a very good philosophy. During this ""going straight"" process, he knows exactly when I, as a beginner, will get puzzled and always put hints at the right place in the book, telling me not to worry if I don't something. He also uses a lot of metaphors to express concepts, making it fun to read but without loss of accuracy.This book is up-to-date and it is a masterpiece.Will update this review as I read through the book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have taken some deep learning classes on Coursera, such as deeplearning.ai or fast.ai class, this book will serve as a refresher and a good tutorial to implement ideas in Keras.  While it does not provide deep theoretical concepts, it explains enough to give you an understanding of what each layer does (conv1D, conv2D, LSTM, GRU, Dense, etc.)  It also teaches about different ways to assemble the networks.  I especially like the chapter that talks about the functional API, where you can have multiple inputs, and multiple outputs, and layer weight sharing.  Most of the other books I read only talked about Sequential models.  This book is not for you, if you are looking for mathematical explanations.  It's perfect for someone who is not too interested in equations, and just want to have practical understanding."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"François Chollet does a phenomenal job explaining the background, fundamentals, and applications of deep learning.  His examples in python are comprehensive, but not overly difficult to grasp.  To boot, he offers python examples for free as Jupyter notebooks available through Github, and many of these include excellent commentary.  My one minor minor gripe is that he goes out of his way to avoid introducing mathematical symbols/nomenclature to make his book more accessible, but I sometimes find explaining things with a little mathematical nomenclature could aid in succinctness without losing the audience."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never been more excited to write a product review! I purchased ""Deep Learning with Python"" for a class this past Monday and received it two days later on Wednesday evening, just in time to do a lot of reading during a holiday weekend. It is the end of said holiday weekend, I have meticulously combed through over half the book in four days, and it looks as though it is the oldest book surviving in my expansive library. The first twenty pages of the book have fallen out because the glue did not hold up to my first few days of studying, and I have highlighted text and penned margin comments in the five chapters. The title suggests how this review shall proceed, and I will not delay much longer.The author is clearly an expert who has spent considerable time thinking about this subject and how best to present it. He dispenses with many popular misconceptions and calibrates the state of deep learning as a research field exceptionally well. He even shares his view on where the AI field is headed in the next thirty years, which could be good boiler plate for any reader if he (she) is considering a career in machine learning or data science. When describing network modeling, Chollet offers sage advice on what steps to take when modeling and why those steps are necessary for building effective models.Chollet mentions that he wants to democratize AI, and I believe this book goes too far to that goal. It is written at a level that most readers, regardless of prior background, could understand. He does not make any attempt to point to other literature on the topic, nor does he contextualize or address many technical points surrounding the topic. This book could serve as a good reference if you are self-studying deep learning and need a reference, but I would not buy it again under most circumstances.Why pass on this book? Because there are better references from course materials or other books that are of better quality than this material. I've had the book for four days, it is falling apart because it was cheaply produced, and I do not feel like the material I've gathered from it so far was anything I could not find on YouTube or in an afternoon of carefully mining materials off the internet. (I believe the author even makes most of his code available on github!)To add insult to injury, the book is just not fun to read. It is in gray-scale and the typography is awful. If you insist on buying this book, I can only recommend buying an electronic version at the steepest discount you can find."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was an incredibly enlightening book. It was also shocking. I had no idea of the extent that bias occurs in the collection of data, the research using the data, and the application of that data to solving problems and designing innovation in the real world. It's as though, as the title of the book suggests, women are completely invisible. I will never look at research data, or the world, in the same way again. This is a must-read for women and men. We need to speak out about this. Fight with women, who are forced to live in a world designed for men and where women must constantly be made to feel out of place. Get this book. Read it. And resist, object, speak up. After reading this book, the world is a different place for me and I hope I never forget the lessons I have learned in reading it."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The book spend an ENORMOUS amount of time talking about the trials and tribulations faced by women with children quite as if, the concept of female was entirely interchangeable with mother.  I got the impression that women who do not have children are quite as invisible to this author as she claims women on the whole are to most men.  When the author started advocating 12 month maternity leave for mother only I gave up on it.  What about those individuals with minor or moderate physical disabilities who would also benefit from parking closer to the building, and more paid time away from the job to tend to their very REAL healthcare needs, these women and men are clearly invisible to this author, I work in a hospital and from what I have observed the out of all the departments in the hospital, including outpatient surgery, the OB has the healthiest patients and one of the lowest mortality rates, so why does a two day stay in the OB garner a minimum of 6 weeks paid leave when end stage renal disease gives you four days a year tops before you have to be back to work? It sound great to say that women should have 12 months off to spend with their new children, but don't these children have fathers wouldn't the fathers like to spend some time with them as well? The author merrily ignores the co-workers of the new parents who are routinely ""asked"" to cancel vacations sacrifice time with their families and freinds and put their personal lives on hold to contribute to this state of maternal bliss, the childless, the elderly who are past childbearing and might want to start cutting back the hours a day they work or who are already partially retired are invisible non-entities in this model that elevates motherhood to goddess like status in the workplace.  This book has it's own bias similar to that which I have observed to often in the medical profession, when it says ""woman"" it means uterus, breasts, and children, and not the people who make up the female half of the population, some of whom will not have uteri, some of whom will not have breasts, and many of whom will not have young children."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Machine learning books have become a dime a dozen. From the moment of receiving this one it was obvious this one stands out from the crowd. Having many such volumes what makes this book special is the depth of coverage in succinct english with examples that clearly illustrates the subject area being discussed.As a newbie to TensorFlow this book is a very good starting point in the journey to proficiency. If you are looking for concise starting points in the areas of machine learning concepts discussed, this book again hits the mark in a clarity not seen in the many other books now collecting dust in my library. The Greeks and mathematical proofs have thankfully left out as if you at the level the book is written to you don't really care anymore. Life's classroom frankly are your results, not a peer review and this book is very much for the practitioner not the academic looking to impress his colleagues in academia.This is a book worthy of being added to your machine learning library and in close proximity to the keyboard as you code to refresh what you thought you knew but long ago forgot was important. Just might donate my machine learning books to others at the local library as this book stands alone in taking up valuable space in a ever decreasing bookcase."

Instructions for setting up a rig are slightly out of date and there are subtle challenges installing the nvidia driver/cudaXX on current Ubuntu 18.04 vs the 16.04 from the book.  Updating the kernel was a key step in my case.  Still, that's to be expected.  I like the top-down approach with Keras sprinkled with increasing amounts of detail as you progress.  Really enjoying coding along the way.  Using python3 + JetBrains PyCharm IDE for both notebooks and straight up py's."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"If this is your first book on machine learning, this book will serve as a survey course across the many areas and topics associated with machine learning. It, however, does not go into any of them in any depth and will leave you with a sea of code that, while functional, will only scratch the surface of what you need to know to use Keras effectively in a real project. For those just getting into the space, it is an invaluable resource to read through so that you can see some use cases for Keras."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Francois Chollet has a great talent to explain even complicated things in a very clear and intuitive way. The book has just enough details: touching all important things and at the same time not going too deep and away from the subject. I found it as an excellent addition to Deep Learning specialization from Andrew Ng on Coursera. I read it from cover to cover, practiced with all examples. These examples are well explained, detailed, and self-sufficient. If you want to try something, just do it - as the book provides all the details you need (you don't even need your own environment - just use colab.research.google.com). So, I want to say big Thank You to Francois for doing such great things for the machine learning community!"

I bought this book to understand what I could do with deep learning in Keras.  I got so much more than I expected.  Having written a single chapter in my own book about algorithms in general, I understand the challenges of trying to explain algorithms enough for general understanding, while not getting too far down the rabbit hole.  I thought this book went to a perfect depth to understand the possibilities with deep learning, and to get hands on creating useful outcomes.  Thanks Francois for the time well spent."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is very useful for an introduction to machine learning in Python using the Keras package. Using this book in conjunction with Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron is even better since the books are complementary and deal with the subject matter in different levels of abstraction. I also find the book Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow to be a useful supplement for a more fundamental presentation of the mathematics and conceptual approaches.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book goes into sufficient detail to explain what is going on and why things are done for different analysis options.  Since I am just beginning in this field it was a good way to get started, although it is a pretty complex subject.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in getting started in AI/Deep Learning."

This book provides clear, step-by-step explanations of how to configure modern neural networks with forthright recommendations for standard problems.

Overall a great book, the only addition I would ask for are easier setup instructions to configure either locally or on AWS / GCP (the current instructions are not as clean as the Tensorflow website)."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this book for my ML-exercises and for getting started with Deep Learning & TensorFlow.This book is the first one which prepares for training deep learning neuronal networks and if you have the hardware, it helps to do it distributed across several computers or at least with more than one GPU.It starts with well written explanations about all common kinds of Machne Learning. Machine Learning algorithms like k-nearest-neighbour, decision trees, SVM and regression are explained with all the math needed (but not too much) and with practical code in Python. Before TensorFlow is used, this book introduces Scikit-Learn as the most important library for ML (and preprocessing and scoring) in Python. All graphics are informative and easy to understand. As this book is going from common Machine Learning _deep_ into Deep Learning, I absolutly do recommend it."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been involved in machine learning as a researcher / practitioner for 5 years, but used R for most of it and was originally reluctant to move to Python (learning pandas, numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn is an intimidating hill to climb when you're already so comfortable in R).I got this book for the deep learning portion (about half of the overall book length), and was shocked at the clarity of the conceptual explanations and code implementations. I've read many extensive explanations of important neural network architectures (FFNs, CNNs, RNNs, ...) and none of them were this clear and intuitive. Within 5 days I was able to go from having zero deep learning experience to easily implementing complicated architectures with TensorFlow.Many people recommend Keras as an alternative to TensorFlow, and I agree... but reading this book allowed me to understand the structure of the underlying code enough to use Keras much more effectively than if I had just started there and never learned what's going on under the hood.I was so impressed with the deep learning portion of this book that I went back and read the rest of it. I can't recommend this work highly enough."

,1.0 out of 5 stars,コードを写経するだけではエラーが起きる箇所がある。著者のGitHubではアップデートされたコードが公開されされているものの、どこが変わっているのかなどを本と照らし合わせて確認しないといけないため極めて非効率。また、前提となるclassの作成について後から補足される等により、デバッグに無駄な時間を費やす等、フラストレーションが溜まることが多かった。コンテンツ自体は良いものの、全体的に不完全・不親切な内容なので改訂版を待つことを強く勧める。
,1.0 out of 5 stars,Complete waste of money... How come every book in this field is half baked waste of paper... It's frustrating. 6000 yen for this shit?!?! Unbelievable. The second half where the author diverges into nueral networks and Tensorflow is absurdly brief regarding the principles of working. Even the code part is not clear. Especially the way the author introduces each new function as just tidbit add-ons is irritating. Where the fuck are you supposed to insert these functions in the original code??? If the price had been reasonable it would have still been a half way decent book. 6000 fucking yen for this ?? Unfucking believable.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has to be at the top of my list of most highly recommended books! The amount of material it covers is awesome, and I can find almost no fault with it. The writing is extremely clear, easy to read, written in impeccable English. Very well edited. I don't think I came across any spelling or grammar errors, or any real errors at all. Truly solid writing.The breadth of information covered if quite wide. The choice to start with Scikit-Learn was interesting, but makes sense on some level while he's introducing the more basic machine learning concepts. Simple machine learning techniques like logistic regression, data conditioning, dealing with training, validation, test set. Even if you've read about these concepts a million times, you might still glean useful information from these pages.The Tensorflow section is also super well done. Straightforward setup instructions, pretty intelligible explanation of the basic concepts (variables, placeholders, layers, etc.) to get you started. The example code is quite good, and the notebooks are quite complete and seem to work well, with maybe a few tweaks and additional setup for some. I also found that the notebooks show more examples than what's in the book, which can be nice.I only went really hands on with the reinforcement learning notebook, and found that it was well done and a good base to start my own work from. Even just having a section on reinforcement learning is very rare in a book of this style, and Geron's samples and explanations are really solid. He obviously has a strong grasp of many varied fields within deep learning, and that includes reinforcement learning. The only thing I wish it had was an A3C sample, to make my life that much easier. But you can't have everything.I really liked his tips on which types of layers, activations, regularization, etc. are most effective, and gives good starting points for decent convergence. His explanation of multi-GPU Tensorflow was also quite good. The Tensorboard section was also very useful.In short, if you want ONE book to get you into machine learning, and Tensforlow is on your radar, you can't go wrong with this one. Highly recommended!"
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this book awhile back, but did not have time to study it. Now that I have had a chance to sit down with the book I have some good things and some bad things to say about the book.The good?The author does a good job in trying to present information in such a way that it gets you thinking about the problems you are trying to solve. The second chapter is a full blown project to take you through the full development cycle.There is quite a bit of code and beginnings of mathematical models presented in the book. So, there is plenty to step off from.The Bad?Most of the code will execute in what ever environment you run your python code in. However, if you want the more optimum or even all the functions used, you will need to go to the authors github repository for the book. I have spent more time on the repository than I have in the book.The book is very Jupyter-centric.The Missing?Deeper explanations! The whole book feels like a 40000 ft view of the subject matter. It also is written from the perspective that you have an intimate knowledge of the python programming language and its libraries. He gives no explanation of builtin functions or methods anywhere in the book or on the repo.I do understand that this is not a theory book, but a little more explanation as to why we are using the libraries, functions, or methods that we are using would be far more beneficial."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a collector of books and classes of machine learning and deep learning for the last few years. Even though I come from a strong theoretical background, I have to say one must do hands on tinkering to be able to solve one's own problem successfully. Then for deep learning one must work with Tensorflow or Theano. However, I have been searching for a good hands-on book on tensorflow and had found none until this book.I purchased the kindle version so I can dive into this book early before the book comes out. I am not disappointed. It gives you the code on the familiar Python notebook to work on. The author really knows about Tensorflow and machine learning, and his teaching shows. There are pieces of information hard to find somewhere else, and I have spent hundreds to thousands to attend workshops.Needless to say, I have not done all the exercises yet. But I like this book enough that I will work on all the problems I am interested in.One disappointment though. I was hoping Keras, a high level api that enables fast experiments, is covered. It is not in this version. Sure hope it will be covered in the updated version."

If you are indeed designing brain's native algorithm, which may imitate emotions, why is not possible for a machine to have freewill. The author is ""tool heavy"", someone who knows how to program but individual examples (say from medicine) again lack depth and understanding.

I only wished I got a chance to read the book earlier; I pretty much re-invented the wheel on bootstrapping non-iid samples but I had to think about two months about the problem.  I recommend this book for anyone that does any kind of quantitative trading as some of the concepts are not necessarily machine learning related.  I never stopped being amazed about how many traders place quantitative bets valued with many zeros without a proper grasp of how cross validation works and how information leaks during back testing from training/validation/test sets.To my knowledge there's no other book with better presentation of machine learning problems that are specific to time series prediction in finance. The best standard books in ML and AI fields focus on vision, language, and scale which are not useful in the context of finance.  In this context the biggest problems are auto correlated data, training samples of small size, non stationary time series,etc. all of which get detailed explanations and recipes for success in the book."

The consequences for women include leading a more challenging, poorer and sicker life.  When it comes to cars, they are far more likely to be seriously injured than a man.Invisible Women is Perez's call to action to business leaders, government officials, universities, particularly medical schools, health care professionals, pharmaceutical companies and urban planners.  By minimizing and ignoring women's perspectives, these institutions are depriving their organizations of 50% of the available world intellect and experiential resource.  As a result, they are also being deprived of higher revenue.  Closing the female representation gap is in the best interest of men too, because the well-being of their wives, mothers and daughters is seriously at stake.Book Review written by Shirley Roberts, Author of Harness the Future."

Only 1 out of 10 citation is actually from a legit reseach paper.For example, in chapter 4, author argues that there is a ""strong evidence"" that woman are discriminated at workplace because ""an analysis of 248 performance reviews collected from a variety of US based tech companies receive negative personality criticism that men simply don't"". This citation comes from an internet article where the author does not explain how data is collected, what are the questions on the survey, and wether or not there are other factors involved....Again, you can argue that this is because not enough academic studies are done on gender biases because female researchers are discriminated and their work don't get published, but I don't see any researches that can prove this bias exist.Overall, one star, because author did not use any real data that are credible."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very informative on the GDP and data bias, there were also many things to be learnt about the tech business.A minor note I must add as a medic is concussions seem to be seen as something women suffer more of, which isn't based on sex, but on gender(they are more likely to be sufferers of domestic violence) whereas women who did sports as children and received concussions have minor effects when receiving concussions as adults, as compared to women who have a concussion for the first time. The first concussion is the one with the most symptoms(an observation made in women, but not men, perhaps because men already received injuries and concussions as children and adolescents through sports the women studied were unlikely to have played in their youth, or perhaps a biological sex difference in response to trauma lessened in further head injuries because the body has already experienced it, this is all open to study).As always with health and fitness, best to be active in youth to reduce injuries and illnesses in adulthood, however most women do not have access to quality taught sports and end up with injuries they continue to work through from their unpaid overwork, which as we know, being active is good but not resting and overdoing it means you have heightened chances of injury, heightened risk of delayed recovery when physically working while injured, risks of further injury and also of health problems in the long run.However on the topic of head injuries, it is still men who suffer worse brain injuries than women even when gender based occupations and behaviours are taken into account.Of course, that does not mean we should ignore it's effects in women but the misinformation of women suffering longer comes from a study of athletes that did not take into account female athletes receive less funding, thus less funding for medical care and that the athletes in question continued to play while injured(which makes an injury worse) and were not diagnosed immediately, thus a gender gap being mistaken as a sex gap. Another study who took this into account and diagnosed male and female athletes immediately following an impact to the head found that there was no sex or gender difference in recovery speed when diagnosed early.However, there is a gender difference when athletes do not have access to care and continue to play injured.Domestic violence survivors are unlikely to receive or seek help immediately following an injury to the head and explains the gender gap there. More must be done to help women and men suffering from concussions, and more must be done to involve women in all areas of decision making for the betterment of women and all of humanity as a whole.This was a very easy to read book and I recommend it to anyone looking to learn on a data gap, and to everyone who doesn't think about it but to whom it will open their eyes.The book arrived in perfect condition and I am pleased with my purchase."

The line could be written as:>>> confusion_matrix(y_train_5, y_train_5)On page 86, first code block, second line, y_pred should be y_train_pred.Likewise, in the code block at the top of page 87, y_pred should be y_train_pred.In the first code block on page 88,>>> y_some_digit_predis needed prior to the last line (in order to output  what appears on the last line.)On page 93, top code block, ""bottom right"" should be ""lower right"".On page 100, last code block, y_train should be y_multilabel (two instances).On page 101, only code block, the third line needs to be above the second line.Also, to make this example work, I had to addfrom numpy import random as rndabove the first line.At the bottom of page 101, it appears that the author meant to show code to produce the images at the top of the next page.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands-On Machine Learning strikes a perfect blend between application and theory. Beginners to machine learning will find it clear to follow and will be able to build complete systems within a few chapters while those with an intermediate level of experience will find a comprehensive, up-to-date guide to this exciting field.Pros:+ Practical: The book focuses on examples and implementations of the algorithms rather than the mathematics allowing readers to quickly build their own machine learning models+ Readable: Geron does not get too caught up in the details, and he provides warnings when the next section is heavy on theory+ Online Jupyter Notebooks: The Jupyter Notebooks that accompany this book (and can even be viewed for free with no purchase from the author's GitHub) are worth the entire purchase price. They feature examples of all the code in the book, plus additional explanatory material. The end-of-chapter solutions to the coding exercises are gradually being added to the notebooks.+ Up-to-date: The leading edge of machine learning (and in particular deep learning) is constantly shifting, and Geron does his best to keep the notebooks updated. Multiple times I have read an ML paper and then found the technique implemented in the notebooks within weeks of the publication of the article. Some of the techniques in the book may not be at the absolute forefront of the field, but they are still good enough for learning the fundamentals.+ Engaging: The book is a joy to read, and the author is quick to respond to issues pointed out by readers in the book or in the Jupyter Notebooks. Clearly, the author enjoys machine learning and teaching it to others.Cons:- Experts may find this book lacks enough depth because it is more focused on getting up and running rather than optimization. It also is specifically aimed towards Python (and Tensorflow for deep learning) so those looking for implementations in other frameworks will have to search elsewhere.- Due to the rapidly-evolving nature of the field, a print book on machine learning will always need to be periodically re-issued to stay on top of all the developments. Nonetheless, the fundamentals covered in this book will remain relevant and the Jupyter Notebooks are constantly updated with new techniques.Final Line: If you have some basic experience with Python (loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and especially Numpy) and zero to a medium level of experience with machine learning, this book is an optimal choice. I would recommend it both for those wishing to self-study and quickly develop working models, and for students in machine learning who want to learn the implementations of more theoretical coursework. I have enjoyed spending time working through the chapters and the exercises and have found this book extremely useful."

You need this book if you want to *understand*, from a critical perspective, how to accomplish things like -  selecting features, culling data, creating provably-suitable ML models, model/data validation, and what it takes to actually get an ML platform to do something truly useful and meaningful to you!In return for being so useful, the author requests something from you - get your hands on the keyboard, and actually work with Python Scikit-tools as well as the Jupyter workbooks that accompany the book (on github).  You should have knowledge of Python, as many of the ML concepts are reinforced through concrete implementations in Python code.  And work you must, as - after all - the book's title includes the words ""Hands-On""!I respect where the author is coming from, as he is trying to reduce his obvious experience in ML down to a ""Hands-On"" working environment.  I believe he has accomplished this goal very admirably.  His easy style of writing encourages you to try things for yourself, and removes the worry that you may ""break something"" along the way.  What truly impresses me beyond even all of this is that English is not his first language!  So - again, this work is very impressive on many fronts.SIDE NOTE: This book will likely work for readers with both ""step-by-step"" and ""random-access"" learning approaches, as no topic appears to rely so heavily on the previous one(s) that it can't be understood on its own merits.  Again - a very impressive feat, especially in light of the heady material being covered.  Major Cudos by Mr. Géron!"

However if you want to buy this book because you think this is an ""easy door"" into machine learning, then forget it!For starters, the author has double problem of1. Conveying theory: probabilistic distributions, cost functions, optimizations, secularization ...  (which is absolute must for machine learning)And then he has to teach:2. Art of implementation (Tensorflow scikit etc...)You cant gainfully accomplish #2 without #1. And doing #1 is the ""hardest"" part and there is no way around it.I think without solid grasp of Multivariate & Vector Calculus, Deep Statistics, Advanced Matrix Theory, Probability & Information Theory, Linear Algebra and finally the almighty Tensors, there is no way anyone can reasonably model ML/AI algorithms or Neural Net models.So my sincere suggestions read books to do #1. Then if at all you succeed, come to #2 and buy this book for it.With lot of hard effort I am reasonably succeeding in #1 - yet I still have to wait before I can get to #2"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of the most accessible machine learning books out there for developers. It strikes a nice balance between intuition, mathematical details and implementation specifics. I would highly recommend this book to beginners and intermediate ML practitioners. I'm only giving it four stars because despite the content itself being great, the print does have some issues like missing diagrams (see attached pictures)."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I read the Geron book ""Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-learn & TensorFlow"" before reading Muller's. (Note: I did not read the TensorFlow section). I think that was a mistake. Muller's book provides a better start for several reasons. First, it is better organized. Second, the code implementations rely primarily on Python modules, instead of custom programming. I would have given this book 4 stars before reading Muller, because I didn't have anything to compare this book to.Regarding the first reason, Muller's book is set-up so that a reader can get an understanding of Machine Learning (ML) step-by-step from the bottom-up. For instance, supervised learning, feature engineering, and model evaluation all get separate chapters. The model evaluation chapter provides and entire section, as well as graphics, for understanding the roles of training, validation, and test data, which are probably the most important bedrock concepts in ML. In contrast to this, Geron throws you right into an entire ML pipeline in the second chapter. It's a mix of feature engineering, linear models, stochastic gradient descent, random forest models, cross-validation, grid search, and even custom object oriented programming for custom transformers! This might be useful for quickly understanding what ML is like in practice. If the remaining parts of Geron then went step-by-step and elaborated on the second chapter for the remainder of the book, it would be great. Instead, for instance, the second chapter is randomly about binary classification for picture data. You literally only get two paragraphs in the first chapter on cross-validation and validation sets, and a sentence or two later in the book. I had to go to Wikipedia to ensure that I understood it correctly and robustly. I wish I had read Muller's book instead.Regarding the second reason, Muller's book does not assume a heavy programming background. Most of the ML pipeline is taught through the Python module Scikit-Learn. This is useful because the programming does not distract from learning fundamentals of ML. In contrast, in the second chapter of Geron, there is object oriented programming code involving concepts like constructors and inheritance. For Muller's book, the most sophisticated chapter at the end, which is on pipelines and which expertly explains why feature engineering should be performed during model evaluation, doesn't even go into this.In summary Geron teaches more advanced topics interspersed with the basics without a coherent organizational structure. Muller's book has an intuitive structure that elaborates at length on core ML concepts and doesn't overburden with complex programming. I might say read Geron after Muller, but I'm not sure that is even correct. You're best bet is probably just using the internet (Towards Data Science; Kaggle kernels) to learn more sophisticated things after reading Muller."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm only two chapters in, and I find this book to be an absolutely frustrating way to become familiar with machine learning techniques. Not only do the code examples in the book frequently not run correctly, but the same happens with the updates to the code made by the author on Github. Please address these issues associated with categorical attributes and transforming data in Chapter 2 in future releases so that users can actually run your code and proceed with the remainder of the examples."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is great. Covers majors topics in Machine Learning, with qualitative and quantitative explanations of each topic. Cites all sources, so reader may go deeper if desired.Supervised algorithms include: k-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks (perceptrons, deep neural nets, convolution & recurrent neural nets).Unsupervised algorithms include: clustering (k-Means, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, Expectation Maximization), visualization and dimensionality reduction (Principal Component Analysis, Kernel PCA, Locally-Linear Embedding, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), autoencoders (denoising, sparse, variational), and Boltzmann Machines (including Deep Belief Networks).Important concepts covered include: cross-validation, confusion matrices, precision, recall, ROC curve, gradient descent (batch, stochastic, mini), regularized linear models (ridge, lasso, elastic net), gini impurity & entropy, bagging, pasting, boosting, backpropogation, autodiff (forward and reverse), activation functions, initialization methods, regularization (dropout, early stopping, etc.), layer freezing and caching, optimizations, LSTM cells, SVM dual problem, and reinforcement learning (covering policy gradients, markov decision processes, temporal difference learning and Q-learning)."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent book. So many books about artificial intelligence are available in the last few months. So far, this is the best in terms of deep understating of Python coding line-by-line available in github site. It took me a lot of time to understand every line of Python coding in this book. Without this line-by-line Python coding from the above-mentioned site, it is difficult to have in-depth insight of AI learning. One caveat of the coding in this site is ""coding may not be 100% correct"". On Sept. 25, 2017, coding on chapter 16 for PacMan game was modified and critic q_values used in training_op was modified to actor q_values and it is a significant deviation of algorithm. Since I am a beginner and usually I trust completely the algorithm of its coding, I hope this is the only substantive modification of the coding in this amazing book."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought this book was good, however I am a bit disappointed, found some of the concept explanations a bit vague, it seems to me that if you fail to explain the linear regression, don't get me started with the messy examples.

It's even hard to say who should read the book.. If you go to the bar and after third pint decide to talk about ML this would be it. Lack of systematic approach, lack of relevant explanations of what are applicable areas of particular methods... NOTHING... skimmed through 3 chapters and still have an impression I'm reading and intro section.. Just wondering who are all the people who gave it 5 stars :("
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not good.  Mr. Domingos clearly knows a lot about machine learning, but he is on his personal hunt for something that doesn't exist yet, what he calls the master algorithm which is supposed to unify all the techniques of machine learning into a single algorithm.  The whole book is his trying to sell his idea of this non-existent master algorithm as something that does exist, and just needs to be found.The byline on the book from Walter Sara son says ""Domingos demystifies machine learning"", which made me expect this would be a book that helps educate on the basics of machine learning (as they exist) and its implementations and uses.  But instead it is just a book about Domingos windmill he is chasing."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Haven't read the Tensor Flow part yet (second half of the book) but the first half was extremely enjoyable. When you are reading it pay attention to details (narrative) because the author is sharing very practical approaches to some problems. I've read many other books on Machine Learning but they are too academic (other authors often times omit practical issues like complexity of the algorithms, etc.).I'm excited to read the second half too, and then I may update my review accordingly.If you're wondering if this books is right for you I'd recommend downloading the first chapter for free on Kindle. You will see that the author has a gift of writing in such a way that you are not tired reading it. Few authors have it.Highly recommended."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With the rise of deep learning we have ended up getting so many people writing terrible books on the topic just to make a quick buck. The field is moving fast and people are really in need of good sources so a lot of us end up handing out cash for books that look like they have been written over a few days by copying and pasting content from the internet. I fell for some of these books (many written through packt publishing).Not this book though! the author is a legitimate computer scientist and he has written an amazing book that i think is useful both to researchers and practitioners.However, i just wish he would write a new edition and incorporate some of the new changes to tensorflow!  I would happily pay to buy his new edition.H"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent book. The information provided is a fantastic introduction to machine learning and deep learning with Tensorflow. I got into the machine learning world via Andrew Ng's Coursera course as well as fast.ai courses on deep learning. I felt like there was always some knowledge assumed about ordinary machine learning that I was lacking. E.g., what's an appropriate cost function? what's the real difference between classification and regression? This book provides that foundation. I finally feel like I have a firm grasp of machine learning.I did not spend too much on the Tensorflow part of the book because I have been working mainly with PyTorch. But whenever it becomes necessary for me to learn Tensorflow, the second part of this book will be the first place I turn.Despite what other reviews say, the print quality of the book is excellent like a typical O'Reilly book. But you have to be careful not to buy it from resellers who will sell you copies of an early release that they printed off the internet and glued together. I made this mistake and had to ask Amazon for a refund to buy the genuine article. The resellers will price their book just a couple of cents below the real thing so when you Add to Cart, it will add their counterfeit book and you won't realize it until you receive it in the mail. Take care to ""See all buying options"" and only buy if it is Sold by Amazon.com. ""Fulfilled"" by Amazon is not good enough. The seller itself should be Amazon.com. Otherwise there's a good chance you will get a very poor quality copy that many of the reviews are complaining about."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a person who is brand new to machine learning, I must say that this book is very easy to read and understand unlike a lot of other books that drown you in theory before you even know where it's going. I think the format of the book is very well-thought out. Chapter 2 (out of 16 chapters) being an ""End-to-End Machine Learning Project"" really helped in setting the stage in a very hands-on manner. I love how the exposition on the statistics, linear algebra, and other mathematical concepts involved in machine learning are introduced only when needed while still being thorough enough to have a good understanding. I can't say enough good things about this book. I highly recommend it to anyone new to machine learning."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is by far the best material I have come across when it comes to machine learning, more than Methods of Statistical Learning, which many people consider to be the Bible in the subject. The author lays out how projects should go from the planning phase all the way to the maintenance phase. Each algorithm is discussed in detail with use cases and without drowning the reader in math proofs. Each piece of the code is discussed. If it has been a few years since college then the included Jupyter notebook math refresher is enough to get the gist of what's going on in the background and follow along.From basic linear regression to multiple neural networks to recreate something similar to AlphaGo, this book has it all."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Outstanding text for bringing non-computer scientists and non-mathematicians into the field.I'm teaching a group of biomedical researchers, who will ultimately be machine learning end users, from this book.If you are looking for a practical introduction, and guide to avoid the large number of pitfalls in ML, this is a good place to start.If you are looking for a deep, theoretical tome, look elsewhere.A knowledge of Python / Jupyter Notebook are helpful, but a software engineer will go into convulsions upon seeing the organization of the code."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing resource for ML and TensorFlow. Geron's book really shines when he demystifies TensorFlow through building structures with basic parts to first illustrate what's going on under the hood, and then using built in functions to replace the basic parts to make things practical. In doing so, I was able to understand exactly what was going on in each of the neural net architectures, as well as learn how to structure a proper TensorFlow program. The diagrams he includes are also extremely helpful. If you're unsatisfied with knowing what neural nets generally do, and want to learn *just* enough mathematics and the underlying programming going on behind the scenes, then this book is for you!One thing to note is that in my print copy of the book, there are a few diagrams (very few, like 3-5, out of probably a hundred total) which are missing, as in the diagram box is there but it's just white space inside. It's odd, and while it doesn't happen often, it still makes me urge the buyer to go with the e-book version instead."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The author has done a good job in providing ""Hands-On"" material to go along with theoretical understanding of Machine Learning. Other authors will do better justice to the explain the theory and show the math, e.g. Tom Mitchel; Christopher Bishop, et al; Richard Duda, et al, etc. But when reading these books while taking classes, I felt that I was missing details on how to go about to practice the theory. The author, as an expert practitioner, provides code on to clean up data, find relevant attributes, and use different and alternate methods to understand data. This a great introduction to practical matters in Machine Learning. It is a great companion to be able to run experiments to practice the theory,"

,5.0 out of 5 stars,世の中の様々な事柄が、女性のこと（主に、①女性の体のこと、②女性がその多くを担っている家事・育児・介護等（unpaid care work）のこと、③女性が男性から受ける攻撃・暴力等のこと）を考慮に入れないで決められており、結果として女性に不利な、女性に負担を強いる世の中になっている。著者は本書で、そのような事実を具体例、具体的なデータ等を挙げながら丁寧に説明していきます。いくつか例を挙げてみますと…・薬の治験者は主に男性であり、そうして開発された薬が女性にも処方されるが、男性と女性では薬の効き方が異なるので、女性に対して、効かない薬が処方され続けることがある。また、治験者を女性として薬が開発されないので、女性に効く薬が開発されにくい。・自動車の安全性テストは、男性と女性とでは体の特徴が違うにも拘わらず男性のダミーだけで行われるので、衝突時に女性の体に与える影響が検証されておらず、車の事故が発生すると女性の方がより重症になりがち。・最新のテクノロジー製品は、開発者が男性中心なので、音声認識システムは女性の声をうまく認識できないし、スマートフォンは女性の手に収まらない大きさになっている。・仕事で使う農機具、工器具、工事機械、作業服、安全用具等が男性の体を基準に作られているので、女性の体に合わず、女性の体に負担をかけたり、女性の体をしっかり守れていなかったりする。・オフィスは男性の使用を前提に作られているので、ドアは女性にとって重すぎるし、室温は女性にとって低すぎる設定になっている。・女性がその多くを担っている家事、育児、介護等（unpaid care work）の都合を考慮に入れないで街づくりが行われるため、団地や公営住宅の周辺に必要な施設（スーパー、病院、保育園、幼稚園、バス停等々）が設けられていなかったりして、女性に負担がかかっている。・我々は子供の頃から女性に対するステレオタイプ（控え目？優しい？感情的？）が刷り込まれるため、積極的・野心的な行動は、男性だとプラス評価されるが、女性だとマイナス評価されるといったことが起こる。会社、大学等における採用、評価、昇進等においてもそうだし、公職の選挙においてもそうである。・上記のようなステレオタイプがあるため、女性の発言は、男性の発言よりも妨げられ、遮られることが多いし、非難、批判を受けやすい。・女性が男性よりも家事、育児、介護等（unpaid care work）を担っているので、会社内では同じ労働時間であっても、unpaid care workを含めると女性の方が総労働時間が長くなり、結果として女性の方が病気になる可能性が高くなるが、その対策がとられていない。・災害時や紛争時の避難所は、女性のニーズや安全を考慮せずに設営、運営されることが多いので、女性が必要なものを入手できず健康を害したり、男性からの暴力にあったりして、普段よりも一層不利な立場に追い込まれる。・女性の安全を考慮せずに、駅やバス停が建設、設置されるので、女性は男性からの暴力にあうことを恐れて、危険そうな場所や時間帯を避けざるを得ず、女性の行動範囲や行動時間に制約が生じている。他にも沢山、女性が不当に負担を強いられている例が挙げられています。その上で著者は、「人口の半分を占める女性」のことが考慮されずに物事が決定されているのは問題だとして、①女性にも影響を与える事柄を決める際には、男性だけでなく女性の意見やニーズ等もよく聞き、男性だけでなく女性についてのデータも積極的に収集し、その上で意思決定すべきである、②男性は女性のニーズが見えていない（男性と別のニーズがあることに気づかない）ので、意思決定にもっともっと多くの女性を参加させる必要がある、と主張しています。本書では、女性に負担を強いている実例が約300頁にわたって次々と述べられるので、正直なところ圧倒されてしまい、読んでいて少し辛くなってきますが、それだけこの問題は根深いのだと思います。本書を読んで、男性として自分が見えていなかった現状が少し見えてきたので、読んで良かったと思いました。以前読んだSheryl Sandbergの「Lean In」の話が少し出てきたのも、興味深かったです。単語も文章もそこそこ難しく、読むのに多少骨が折れると思いますが、具体的な事例が豊富で、日本の事例もしばしば出てくるので、興味深く読めると思います。時々、文章にユーモアが感じられるのもいいです。これからの社会のあり方を考えるために、女性はもちろんのこと、男性にもぜひとも読んでいただきたい本だと思いました。

,5.0 out of 5 stars,this book is an absolute must read. sometimes makes you just furious how disgustingly unfair and unequal our society is. share this book and its knowledge with your fellow male friends and homegrown misogynists/sexists to spread awareness. the book was delivered in a perfect condition.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent starting point for deep learning.  The author is clear and concise and supplies step by step instructions for getting your feet wet with deep learning software and applications... Kudos... The author needs to write more books.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good book to get into deep learning. It gets you a macro view of the topics needed to get you started. I have recommended it to all of my software developers.  They might not develop any ml software but they all need to understand it.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is very well-written. It worked for me as I have classical statistical and machine learning training, but wanted hands-on experience, which the book provided."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this book~~~ great buying experience ^^
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent book. Was very useful in my deep learning class.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good packaging for the book with three types of wraps as in the picture and the book is great for who wanted to lear deep learning. I recommend it with rate 10/10
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book to learn on Keras and NN. Loved reading it every page. Learned lots of tricks and tips.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to get a good understanding of Deep Learning. Python-based projects are the great resources to align with theory.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,so damn good !
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well written. Easy to understand. Great examples. Best practices and good defaults for getting started.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The book covers more of the topics included in a Machine Learning or Data Science course. It has a balanced mix of theory and practical examples. In this context, the book is perfect for those beginning in this subject. Also for teachers as a reference and to get good examples of hands-on activities, and perhaps, for more experienced users that want to enhance their programming skill and to understand the whole work flow along a machine learning project."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Like it overall but could be written in a way easy to follow. Most of time, i am getting lost in details and having hard time to follow.  Good thing is codes in the book are provided over github and author is updating/fixing the code based on feedbacks from the readers."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,There is not a single page you should miss from this work. This book deviates from theoretical ML; however take an approach of actual practitioner from the very beginning. A lot of basic examples. There are various of other resources he adds to help you understand. Check his git-hub code examples. Very simple to comprehend and robust at the same time.This book is a must read for a beginner data scientist.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very insightful book, teaching the aspects of Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow use with python. Not only did I learn something as soon as I opened the book, I am having a blast following along with the examples. In chapter 2 you prepare some data and train and test some actual models. In chapter 3 you get to recreate the famous MNIST test, the “hello world” of machine learning, they say. Scikit-Learn makes these things very simple and easy to understand.My only gripe is that the book could go into a lot more detail about how certain models work and why certain things work the way they do. It could also speak more about the internals of the tools, like Scikit-Learn, and the architecture and function of the code behind the functions.But, overall, this is a great introduction to ML and those two tools."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It has been a valuable resource as I have been learning machine learning. My wish is that it had some more instruction on using TensorFlow. That said, this has been an indispensable resource for neural networks, SVMs, and ensemble learning. Chapter 2, and end to end process of developing an ML ""product"", filled in some gaps that were missing from other resources."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a software engineer who has been curious about machine learning since college. I read this book in my free time hoping to learn more and to scratch the itch to refresh on math and this book blew my expectations out of the water.This book goes into depth to teach readers how the mathematics of the software they are using works, and by doing so it makes machine learning seem like way less of a black box. You understand how support vector machines or varying kinds of neural networks perform machine learning tasks, instead of these models being mostly plug-and-play like other books I have looked at.I especially recommend you do the coding portion and exercises in the book, as they really test your knowledge and make you think. I also recommend Google Colab to host the Jupyter notebooks!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Delivers a well rounded understanding of machine learning and the tools and algorithms that go into the subject.  The author's experience in the field is presented in practical, easy to relate to ways that I found useful immediately.  It's by no means a tutorial and not for someone brand new to python or computer programming but for someone with a bit of experience it's an excellent book for learning how to practically apply machine learning in your own projects."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Received this book yesterday evening and I have spent about 5 hours reading the first 2 chapters, browsed the Exercises and Solutions. I have also downloaded the set of Jupyter Notebooks and executed a few of them successfully. There is a wealth of information on ML algorithms and processes discussed in this book. I am eager to read the rest of the book and soak in the tremendous wealth of knowledge presented, with such clarity and purpose. My kudos to Aurelien Geron, for educating us in ML through this well written book."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is much too thick of a book to be paperback.  There's no weight in the cover to hold the book open so you can read and type at the same time.  And it is a book on programming in python, so reading and typing at the same time is pretty important.  If they had a hardcover version, or made it a little taller so it was less thick, it would be great.  but at near 2 inches, it's just too much.The content itself is good.  It reads easy and explains what you're doing well.  It gives good example exercises for practice."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've used this book for an undergraduate course in Machine Learning and it did not disappoint at all. The combination of theory and direct applications make this book just excellent. I cannot even begin to recommend a better book for people who want a career in ML.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,A challenging read! But necessary to see the coming revolution.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,:)
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great primer for a non technical person as myself. Immensely valuable and complex information in a simple form that was easy to grasp.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really enjoyed this book and it has opened my mind to new perspectives of machine learning and its place in the future.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very well written. Often funny. Very good as an introduction to machine learning. Highly recommended.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Eye-opening insights. I could not put the book away! Incredible research and fundamental data - in my opinion, a must read for everyone!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Livro muito bom. Me fez ver a questão da invisibilidade das mulheres numa perspectiva que eu não tinha pensado antes. Realmente há muitas questões ainda a serem tratadas para a igualdade de gênero.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Caroline Criado Perez puts concrete numbers on things that before I had only hunches, suspicions and imaginings about. Not did I find out I am I not crazy, but this book opened a whole world for me on how to communicate about gender and society. As she says, women are not a niche, we are 50% of the population, and need to stop treating ourselves as if we were an afterthought in creation. Thank you Caroline, you've hit the nail on the head an in a factual and humouristic way given us avenues to restructure the world as it should be."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ich habe dieses Buch bereits mehreren Menschen in meinem Umfeld empfohlen und kann dies nur weiter tun, es zeigte mir noch einiges auf, was ich nicht wusste."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well cited and in depth. Love this book and would encourage everyone who is interested in equality to read it.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This has opened my eyes to so many things. I now insist on my friends reading it too
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Este producto es para un regalo, me disgustó que no estuviera envuelto en plástico protector, motivo por el cual venía un poco maltratada la portada de papel y ligeramente manchada la pasta dura."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s been years since I picked up a book that I couldn’t put it down once I started reading.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an excellent, eye-opening book and well worth the read."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good resource. Pick it up if you’re learning python.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The book is from one of the prominent person inside the Deep Learning arena. Started with a little history and subjects are increasing in complexity. Necessary in the library of an AI practitioner.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The content. Use it in my course.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gift for son. He said it was excellent.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,He explains the blocks of the overarching concepts very clearly. Good book!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First listened to this on Audible, liked it so much, I wanted the physical book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an excellent introductory-intermediate level deep learning book. It covers core concepts as well as practical examples that help to establish your own model. This introduces additional resources that could be helpful.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book it my go to book when I have to understand and implement a deep learning algorithm in limited amount of time. It covers the basic and provides good examples that you are good to go right after reading what is said in the session. The graphs and explanation are understandable and concise. It is enjoyable to read even this is supposed to be a tool book. Recommend.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The book itself is excellent and very hand-on indeed. However, the book I purchased and filled by amazon has the entire Table of content and preface missing. I couldn't believe it and obviously saw the TOC from the ""look inside"" feature. Very disappointed from whatever the publisher and Amazon fulfillment! I expected the slightly higher price paid for books filled by Amazon would have higher quality."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The author does a good job explaining many ML concepts (to the uninitiated like me), but quite a few sections are not clear enough.The book leaves me wondering what is so impressive about discovering past correlations, and extrapolating their validity to the future.  It sounds like most ML approaches are simply attempts at quantified superstition.  Perhaps, that is the value of the book: it can make you disillusioned about ML."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am halfway through the book and trust me being a beginner, I can say this book has helped me in a variety of ways and, to be honest, I can actually apply for Data scientist jobs. Thanks to my professor who recommended me this book!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is the first machine learning book you must buy because it covers essentials and the projects. Also it has many concept questions helping you to prepare for machine learning job interviews.As I see, the book is much better than the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning or Statistical Learning."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is a real gem, not only giving us the how but the what and why as well. It ably introduces the relevant theory along with how to implement the necessary algorithms in scikit-learn and tensorflow and pointers for more in-depth reading. I've looked at other books on tensorflow and ML and this is the best I've found."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Out of the dozen or so books on machine learning and deep learning I've worked through over the past year this has been the best by far. The writing style is concise while still very informative; it gives a great starting point for anyone interested in machine learning/deep learning without getting too bogged down with theory, though it does give just enough to understand what's going on. This book left me wanting more and gave many great leads on where to find information to further my studies. It reinvigorated my desire to work (and play) with machine learning techniques, which was much needed after being let down by so many other books. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about machine learning and TensorFlow."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I come to this with a couple years' experience with Python, and a bit of exposure to Pandas. I found it well-written, concise, and practical where other books on ML have been too dense and theoretical/academic.I would recommend (as does the author n the first pages of the book) having at least a little experience with Python before getting into this."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are plenty of other enthusiastic reviews here, but I nevertheless felt compelled to add another.  I have bought hundreds of technical computer/software books over the past three decades and I would rank this one in the top 1%.  As others have said, the breadth of coverage and clarity of explanation are outstanding."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to understand coming from an engineering background with plenty of practical examples of different machine learning techniques in python. Various algorithms and analysis techniques are covered but would of liked to have some extra sections cover bayesian models and some statistical evaluation methods. Overall I would buy again but would also complement with another book that goes into greater depth in the theory.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As others pointed out, lots of figures are missing in this book because of printing issues. It’s annoying since you won’t be able to follow the author’s comments without those pictures.With that being said, the book itself is very well written and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good beginning book for machine learning and deep learning."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Prefer a textbook, a few weeks Python skill and some cloud resources to appreciate the references."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book is excellent and it is written by one of the best researchers in machine learning in the whole world.
,4.0 out of 5 stars,A nice introduction to data analysis through statistics. As data analytics matures much of the material presented here will be introduced into a new stat package. As the book promises your new algorithm will not be publishable unless you produce a better algorithm. However an instructor of known knowledge will have employment for years to come teach the rest of the world how to see into the nebulous future
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This book offers no new insights for machine learning experts. The excessive story telling and missing facts may even confuse newcomers,  since a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. However, the author shows talent in writing science fictional novels."
,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Too lightweight for a practitioner to learn much from it other than the ML World of Pedro Domingos. Yet at the same time too buzzwordy for someone outside the field to really learn anything substantial/actionable from it.  Neural Networks, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, Classifiers, and Genetic Algorithms are really not all that complicated to understand (though admittedly sometimes hard to implement), and they have been explained better elsewhere.  To that end, I highly recommend Michael Nielsen's online book ""Neural Networks and Deep Learning."""

,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this book. It points out all of the inequalities and ridiculousness that is going on around the world.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best book written so far in the topic! I highly recommend it.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Eye opening read, difficult to put down."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,A highly recommended book for enlightening oneself on the world biased against men.Book quality was fine.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,If I could prescribe only one book to everyone I know it would be this one. Changed my way of looking at the world. Must read!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This amazing book blows a huge hole in the biased data which is utilised worldwide.  An absolutely must read for all women and men.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect as an introduction to the powerful tools of deep learning. The author provides easy to follow code examples and explanations if you have general knowledge of Python.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very well written book. I recommend it for anyone interested in deep learning.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's very helpful for beginners who want to learn how to use Keras create neural networks since a lot of whole codes are given.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book for learning deep learning
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am satisfied with the quality of the printing.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Vary practical and well written - many practical examples. Helped me a lot in Coursera Specialization on Deep Learning
,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm learning a lot!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I found the explanations conversational, intuitive and straightforward.  I also liked that it contained no math formulas."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an exceptional book. The author clearly has put a lot of thought into how to present topics and what is the best strategy for teaching the concepts. It is very hard to find a book that is written as clearly and thoughtfully as this one. The author explains all the basics and clears up all the ambiguities that you may find in other books. This is the type of book that can be read by a complete beginner and bring them up to speed very quickly.I cannot say enough about how good this book really is. If you can only buy one book on deep learning, this should be the one you buy."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great book at great price.If the seller could send the pdf version, that would be great!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Handson books are easy to understand and I like it because you can pace up according to one's level of understanding.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands-down the best book on machine learning I have read to date (and I have three other books).  Not only does the first half of the book give you a nice overview of the major ML techniques, but the second half illustrates how to implement many of these in TensorFlow. The author has a very clear style. It has already helped with the redesign of my neural field model."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An excellent starter for those who want to get hands-on with creative projects. Really loved the approach in ""Chapter 2 – End-to-end Machine Learning project"" - this gives you an overview / big picture of the whole scenario, so that you understand the details before jumping deep with a particular ML algorithm.Certainly recommend this!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just started the book but I have to say that so far I found it to be amazingly explanatory and clear in its examples. I didn't have any previous knowledge on ML but the concepts were introduced in a didatic and intuitive manner. The pratical examples also help to demonstrate the potential of the applications of ML.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great book for software engineers who want to know more about machine learning. I took the machine learning class on Coursera which was a great introduction in matlab to ML. I was looking for something with more details that covers all different algorithms. This book is exactly that. My python knowledge is also just basic and I haven't struggled at all.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have read many books on Machine Learning (ML) and I am also a reviewer for several AI journals and conferences. This book is one of the best in terms of explaining the theory in simple terms and very valuable from the perspective of the practical knowledge you may get from it. After reading it, I am sure you can start right away building real-world ML products using Scikit-Learn and/or TensorFlow."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first chapters were an excellent intro into Machine Learning, followed by an introductions to tensorflow together with NN. I liked the book a lot.If a new edition is planned I would propose to include Keras as an abstraction on top of tensorflow for the NN part. It is a big jump from sklearn to tensorflow and the gap to Keras is far smaller (although I suppose the model implementation must be more flexible)."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"While I am familiar with ML theory, I was interested in learning about modern practice, and this book was extremely helpful in that regard.  I loved the author's very careful writing, it is obvious that he lavished this book with love and attention, and it shows."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great book with good coverage of important topics. Unfortunately wildly full of errors - would've had an easy five stars if they'd bothered getting a couple of people to proof-read it.Still easily worth the purchase price.
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This book was absolutely awesome for the first half. Great overview of machine learning concepts and introduction to sklearn. However, the first code example in the second half of the book (introducing TensorFlow) doesn't work, because it's built for TensorFlow 1.x. Surprise: TensorFlow is currently on version 2.1.0. This major release looks like it has a good amount of changes, so all of the code examples are useless. BUY THE SECOND EDITION THAT COVERS TENSORFLOW 2!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gostei bastante do livro pois traz muitas informações e opinião baseada em dados.Me surpreendi com várias das questões levantadas pelo livro.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Um livro excelente que vale a pena ler.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Essential
,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is pretty easy to understand.This is a good book.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a fantastic book on Python-based Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and also Tensorflow, which has APIs built on Scikit-Learn. As a former Google employee, Geron has had long experience with the Google ML stack since before Tensorflow was open-sourced and made available to the public. His experience is revealed in his outstanding presentation of both the basic concepts and key details of these ML frameworks."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Read this book _before_ you pick up one of the ' standard' texts on the subject such as Deep Learning by Goodfellow et al.To make the most of this book, be sure to first brush up on Python and Linear Algebra."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good to ramp up on Tensorflow. Step by step code will help you to understand what you are doing. Highly recommend.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Another must have hands on machine learning guide book for aspiring data scientists. It should be on your shelf if you want to pursue a career with heavy use of machine learning models done in python.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best book on ML so far.  I am actually only 1/2 way thru it, but I found it to be really good - goes to medium depth on the algorithms and tries to show/explain things very well.On Kindle it doesn't render so well -- the code wraps too much, but otherwise its great."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,Some used Statistics and Linear Algebra books will be helpful in understanding this very good book. Actually teaches enough fundamentals to be useful which is difficult to find in this field. I have found there is no good place to start in machine learning. Just jump in.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands-On Machine Learning is well written with up to date examples for a field that is constantly changing and updating. The code examples are great to help you get started, and the explanations are some of the easiest to follow. I highly recommend this textbook for people who are new or just getting into Machine Learning. However it is lacking in more advanced topics so if you aren't new or aren't missing foundational gaps in your ML knowledge, then this book probably doesn't offer you as much value as some other ones."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,Geron expects you to be an fully equipped engineer within the scope of 2 chapters. He just put the code and passes. It seems like this book is for advanced ML pioneers.

,4.0 out of 5 stars,本書は、医療からクルマまで様々な分野において、いかに社会が男性の体格や、男性を中心に集めたデータに基づいて設計されているかを述べた本です。例えば、自動車の衝突実験で使われる人形が成人男性の寸法であるため、概して女性にとって車がより危険なものになっていること、薬剤の効き目に関して性差が考慮されていないこと、等が挙げられます。また、女性が無償の労働（家事・育児・介護など）を多くこなしている現状が見過ごされていることも繰り返し指摘されます。私自身も、車に乗ったり楽器を演奏したりする際に、製品が成人男性を基準としたサイズになっていることはひしひしと感じますけれども、それが当たり前になっていたので、改めて気付かされるポイントもありました。但し、月経や出産などのことは別として、恰も独自且つ別個の「女性の視点」というものがあるという前提も問い直されなければならないと思いますし（その視点自体、社会的性差の所産であることも考えられます）、ハラスメントや性暴力の話も多く（もちろん、これらもまた深刻な課題ですが）、テーマが少しぶれているという印象を受けました。また、女性に合っていないものがたくさんあるとして、ではそれらを女性にも合うように変えれば、今度は男性に合わなくなってしまうという場合もあります。意思決定の場に女性を増やす以外にも具体的な解決策が示されていれば尚良かったと感じます。本文部分は小さい文字で約320ページありますが、読みやすい文体なのでボリュームの割に楽に読める一冊です。巻末には注・インデックス付き。

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This book discourages readers to understand the bare-minimum math behind various ML models, which is sub-optimal as how neural nets work is governed by various mathematical frameworks behind them after all. Besides, somehow it seems to be significantly slower than some other DL frameworks like PyTorch and Caffe. For example, with the same MNIST simple example, achieving the same 99% accuracy took Keras/TensorFlow 10.8 minutes/463% CPU utilization, versus 4.6 minutes/142% CPU utilization with Caffe and 3.7 minutes/112% CPU utilization with PyTorch, respectively. In comparison, Keras took so much time and CPU power.The other issue is unless you are already familiar with both shallow and deep ML models, it might be challenging to fully understand all concepts and terms mentioned in this book. If you are in this kind of situation, check out the book titled ""Machine Learning A Quantitative Approach""   Machine Learning: A Quantitative Approach           and it may help augment your learning with this book quite a bit."

,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high expectations for the book since it was written by the author of the language. I had also just finished Hand-On Machine Learning by Aurelien Geron which was absolutely fabulous and it was serving as a bit of a benchmark. Geron's book is packed full of information and written in a very step by step way. Chollet's book is written in a convoluted round about way and it is difficult to understand his points.The first 100 pages or so is on general deep learning and it is extremely basic. Even though I new these concepts I still found it difficult to follow. The writing is really bad.The more advanced concepts are not any better. Here is an example of the last section I read on page 172 before putting the book down for good.From the section Visualizing heartmaps of class activation""This general category of techniques is called class activation map ( CAM ) visualization,and it consists of producing heatmaps of class activation over input images. A class acti-vation heatmap is a 2D grid of scores associated with a specific output class, computedfor every location in any input image, indicating how important each location is withrespect to the class under consideration. For instance, given an image fed into a dogs-versus-cats convnet, CAM visualization allows you to generate a heatmap for the class“cat,” indicating how cat-like different parts of the image are, and also a heatmap for theclass “dog,” indicating how dog-like parts of the image are.The specific implementation you’ll use is the one described in “Grad- CAM : VisualExplanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization.” 2 It’s very simple:it consists of taking the output feature map of a convolution layer, given an inputimage, and weighing every channel in that feature map by the gradient of the classwith respect to the channel. Intuitively, one way to understand this trick is that you’reweighting a spatial map of “how intensely the input image activates different chan-nels” by “how important each channel is with regard to the class,” resulting in a spatialmap of “how intensely the input image activates the class.”Consider the image of two African elephants shown in figure 5.34 (under a CreativeCommons license), possibly a mother and her calf, strolling on the savanna. Let’s con-vert this image into something the VGG16 model can read: the model was trained onimages of size 224 × 244, preprocessed according to a few rules that are packaged inthe utility function keras.applications.vgg16.preprocess_input . So you need toload the image, resize it to 224 × 224, convert it to a Numpy float32 tensor, and applythese preprocessing rules.After reading this several times I still did not have a good mental formulation of how these heatmaps are put together. I also did not see the need to put in the paragraph about vgg16 preprocessing right here. It is just a distraction from the matter at hand.  The whole book is like this. I was wasting too much energy trying to understand what I believe are basic concepts.I recommend Ina Goodfellow's book on Deep Learning as well as Aurelien Geron's book. For Keras I would recommend the Deeplearning.AI course on Coursera as well as Deep Learning A-Z on Udemy. I do not know of a good Keras book at this time."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like many technical books these days, the source code is available online. I am a big fan of github, and all the source is right there (see comments for the link). I was even more pleasantly surprised to be able to download the PDF directly from the publisher. I love to have these kinds of books on my handheld devices to browse when I'm stuck in transit or at a boring school show (don't hate me, I'm only human).As a huge Linux nerd, it was great to read this on page 64, ""...it's better to be running on a Unix workstation. Although it's technically possible to run Keras on windows, we don't recommend it... using Ubuntu will save you a lot of time and trouble in the long run."" Yes! So true. Make the switch, my friends, and don't look back.I've had a career doing data analysis and data science for several years now, but the day-to-day reality of those positions is usually much more mundane than deep learning or neural nets. Think ""business intelligence"" and ""executive dashboard."" Books like this are a fun way to stay in touch with the leading edge of the field.For everyone wanting to get into this line, take some advice: yes, stay current with the tech reading books like this. But the reality is you will spend 80% of your time just accessing, mining, cleaning and reorganizing your data. And 80% is on the low-side of the typical rule-of-thumb estimates. You need to get really good at these data-engineering skills in actual practice. Corporations don't come to you with a Kaggle-ready dataset and ask for a clever analysis. They come with a vague desire for ""analysis"", whatever that is, and a big mess of crazy outliers, mistakes, missing values, outdated entries, duplications and incompatible datasets. You *will* spend most of your time just morphing this mess into something analyzable. Study books on that skill, too.Meanwhile, I'm a few chapters into ""Deep Learning with Python"" and enjoying it immensely."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is really an eye opening book backed by data (and ironically, by a lack of available data) to make a profound point. I came to this book believing myself already to be proactive about women's rights and issues, but learned that the problem runs so much deeper than I ever realized. And if I'm completely honest, I learned that I've been guilty of unconscious bias by simply not thinking through how certain things might affect women differently. I'm not a big book reviewer or recommender in general, but this important book is one I'm telling people in my world about. I highly recommend that you read this book if you want a better world for everyone."

If you use data, collect data, or think that credible data can be trusted, this book will dissuade you of your illusions. Because so-called credible data kills women. It kills them in car crashes, in hospitals, after natural disasters, and after a winter snowfall. The author shows that gender-neutral data is actually blind to women, and women (and men) suffer the repercussions."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,I struggle to get into nonfiction but cannot put this book down. I'm about halfway through it and every chapter is blowing my mind. The writing is fast-paced and exciting and the content is fascinating!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Did you know that snow plowing/clearing can be sexist?Yup, it is guys. Major streets, highways, and thoroughfares get most of the attention after a snowfall because duh! people need to drive to work and stuff, right? But, according to the author, this benefits men disproportionately as they have relatively straightforward commuting patterns and are less likely to use public transport. Women, on the other hand, must contend with circuitous patterns of commute (i.e. kid's school, groceries, parents, work, laundry, kid's practice, etc.) that not only expose them to less tidy roads after inclement weather, but also sloppy sidewalks that have shown to result in more injuries which translate to lost productivity and eventually more expenditure on healthcare programs, etc. And that's just the appetizer...So....women are difficult to measure, non-linearly commuting humans that do 75% percent of the world's unpaid labor, who are disproportionally affected by cuts to social programs, who are constantly being subjected to an infuriating double standard, and whose contributions to the nation's GDP has been largely unaccounted for.If you are not the ""default human"" in most studies (i.e. a male) then grab some calming chamomile tea and take your blood pressure medication or something cause each chapter is sure to make your blood boil. If you are a ""default human"" however, then be prepared to have an entirely new understanding of the word privilege...There is some overreaching in terms of the arguments that caused me to squint and purse my lips the way I do when I'm extremely skeptical about something, like when she presented the idea that it's hard for women to perform similarly to men in construction jobs cause cement bags are just too darn big and so are bricks! If they were to change the world standard for bricks though...problem solved eh?Also, apparently men drove the trend towards bigger and bigger phones, cause we have big manly hands and we can handle them whereas women must contort their digits in all kinds of ways causing them much discomfort. But they do make them smaller I thought? Anyways, the point is that they won't fit in their darn pants pockets! By Jove, If the patriarchy just stopped designing Lululemons, yoga pants, skinny jeans, pantsuits and tiny purses, then...Hmmm. Methinks women in the fashion industry have it well within their province to address these issues, yes?In general tough, this book is an eye-opening, world-view changing kind of work that has research in spades and deserves every accolade and award thrown its way.Must read recommendation!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a fascinating, dense and at times infuriating book. The author Caroline Criado Perez, bombards the reader with statistic after statistic showing that, not only is the modern world built for men, much of the data we collect about that world either ignores or discounts the differences between men and women. Every paragraph, it seems, has a concrete example, such as, there are no female crash test dummies. Sometimes, scaled-down male dummies are used, but given women's different bone density and muscle distribution, even that's not helpful. Nor are there any pregnant crash test dummies, yet car accidents are the leading cause of fetal death.In many of the instances Perez cites, sex-specific data isn't gathered. One of the outcomes is that problems, such as heart attacks in females, are described as having ""atypical symptoms."" Except since females are 50% of the population, there's nothing ""atypical"" about that. Mind-blowing and infuriating stuff like that flows like water out of a firehose through the pages of this book.I said the book is dense - it's more textbook than beach read. However, it's an important and eye-opening read for both sexes."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I read a raft of feminist nonfiction books, and I must say this was one of the better ones--very good indeed. It was so good, in fact, that I had to put it down from time to time because it upset me by delineating the sheer and overwhelming abuse-by-neglect of half the planet's population.If you are a woman, likely you know a bit of this simply by being alive. But I am betting it's still a new perspective on the ""why"" of it.If you are a man, you may know a few stats, but you almost certainly have no clue about the global and right-in-your-neighborhood ramifications of ignoring the needs of women. (Not just moms--as a reviewer here complained.) From birth, women are never the ""default"" in anything, thus the majority of systems and things never serve them well. The state of sanitary sewer or toileting systems  around the world, alone, along with a lack of running or close-to-fetch water is an often fatal injustice particularly cruel to women and girls.People who make policy--and men--need to read this. Send a copy to your Rep. or Senator?"
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The book serves as very good soft introduction to AI programming, covering topics ""breadth first"" ranging from speech recognition to image generation. It focuses on intuition over mathematics and example over theory. The example over theory philosophy goes perhaps too far in my opinion, as I feel the book leaves the reader with a very limited understanding of how deep neural networks *actually work*.For example, the author explains the sample code, ""keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu')"", as a dot product, an addition, and a max(x, 0).That's useful information, but how does that, or any of the code in the examples, result in a neural network layer that is e.g. better understood as a specific human face than the last layer? It's like explaining calculus by saying, ""all you do is get the tangent line across the curve and then add them all up!"" The intuitive approach is great, but it is less helpful when the reader sits down and tries to solve a real problem.This may be beyond the scope of the book, however. For readers that want to dive in, get started now, and learn as they try new exercises, this is your book!The author is an AI researcher who created Keras, a popular AI library which serves as a popular way to use Google's TensorFlow. Credentials are not a problem.The author says that the reader requires use of a UNIX machine and that, ""It is possible to use Windows, too, but I don't recommend it.""He probably means Linux and MacOS, but considering that Windows has more than 80% market share on PCs, it seems a little more explanation may be in order. Google, the author's employer, is known for being somewhat hostile towards Microsoft. Perhaps that is it? Microsoft is a major player in AI research, often outperforming Google and every other competitor in competitions (e.g. ImageNet image recognition), and they Accord.NET and CNTK (Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit). In fact, CNTK is one of the AI backends that Keras can use along side Theano or TensorFlow!As for those that do not already use Linux as their development OS, search for ""keras on Windows"". There are a few more steps to install all the necessary software, but nowhere near as many as would be necessary to install Linux or change to MacOS.Overall this is a great purchase which I highly recommend as one of many books to help get one started using popular AI libraries."

I'm only at the point of scratching the surface of AI, machine learning, and deep learning but I was attracted to this book for its newbie-friendly approach. The author has avoided deep-diving into mathematical concepts and uses a combination of code examples and situational descriptions to layout easy to understand guideposts.I'm particularly fascinated with the sections on computer vision - that is, using computers to automate parts of the human visual system. This book has fantastic examples that are easy enough to follow.Finally, the introduction to Keras, a deep-learning framework for Python is outstanding. If you're looking into Keras (or one of the other deep learning frameworks) this book is a fantastic starting point!"

I expected a scientific analysis of data bias, and while the information and references were there the bias from the author was too much. Words like “obviously” shouldn’t be used to portray facts."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"TLDR: Average book suffers from exclusion of trans people.I read this book after the author was interviewed on the podcast 99% Invisible. While overall, this book was very interesting and clearly written, it suffers from lack of inclusion of LGBT (particularly trans) identities. I did not understand while reading how someone could write a whole book on the way that gender influences life and not even mention trans people. When I researched a bit further, I discovered that the author ascribes to views of trans exclusionary radical feminism. This fact makes me doubt many of the facts presented in this book and the conclusions that the author draws from it. (Review copy and pasted from goodreads)"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I heard about this book on Roman Mars' podcast ""99% Invisible"" and bought this book as a female who works in User Experience Design, to improve my understanding of data and to hopefully improve my research skills. As someone with a science background, I needed to be convinced on the data and research first, before highly investing (which I am now questioning- because I knew it was written by a female?) and believing the logic.This book is extremely well researched and written, thoroughly logical, and written in a fashion that is not accusing of males (which often isolates those readers). Instead, it is inclusive and instructive.As someone who watched their mother and has personally been, the subject of verbal/emotional abuse, I was able to sympathise and empathise with many aspects of the book. I walked away pissed off in all the right ways.This book is eye-opening, especially for males with an open mind, but even for females who are apprehensive to the extremist qualities of feminism. I recommend this book to so many people on a daily basis now, that they must assume I am being paid for it. Everyone should be required to read this book."

,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Necessary reading.I agree with reviews that point to equating women with caregivers, but that’s not due to oversimplification — it’s due to ground truth.“Women” are a proxy for “all social activity outside of paid work outside the home.” That’s actually the power of the book.I picked this up after The Fabric of Civilization, and it’s a different sort of read.In some ways it reminds me of The Big Thirst by Charles Fischman (which is less listy a la Freakonomics than this is, but still pursues an invisible and yet crucial topic).“Invisible” and “externality” are kind of similar. We should pay more attention to this because it’s a blind spot not just economically but in national security as well."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"ALL THE STARS!  I wanted to read this whole book out loud.  MIND BLOWING.  I especially loved the chapters on transportation bias, gender bias is academia and silicone valley (although you can read “Brotopia” for more on that) and the male default with tool size and stride length and car manufacturing.  If you are in a rush, you can chapter pick here.  The section on medicine, both drugs and mistreatment of healthcare workers was fascinating and so so disturbing, as was the chapter on the gender bias in politics."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The author has done prestigious amounts of research to see what's missing in most of the data sets that guide public policy, corporate decision making and medical practice. Time after time she found that women's perspectives are missing or that the data did not distinguish between men's women's patterns of behavior or health outcomes.  I appreciated her efforts to include data from around the world, while adding some personal stories of her life in the UK.  The book is quite dense with facts and figures (about 40% of the pages are actually footnotes), so I found myself skimming many paragraphs but her information and conclusions are certainly worthy of consideration."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Throughout my time reading Invisible Women, I frequently found myself questioning things. Whether the words shared were accurate (they were), whether the gender gap was as real as author Caroline Criado Perez was making it out to be (it is), and if women are truly putting up with as much inequality as was portrayed (they are).As a guy, it feels as though this book ought to be required reading for my fellow fellows. At multiple times during the read, I sat down with some close female friends, asking for their thoughts on certain passages, and the universal reaction was ""yes, that's my everyday life."" The feeling evoked after these conversations were both ones of enlightenment and frustration.I walk away after having read this book with an altered perspective and new context for what my friends and family tolerate each and every day. It is affecting, and has inspired change in how I personally approach my own priorities moving forward.Please make the time to add this book to the front of your queue!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book clearly describes the negative impact of policy, buildings, cars, algorithms, city planning... to a limited subset of humanity (frequently white men). With no malice a limited subset of humanity does not know what they do not know. We are deprived of the wisdom and contribution of all of humanity. The data is shocking. Lives are lost, injuries occur and quality of life is diminished.Simple example: Woman are more likely to die in car accidents as both the driver or passenger since autos are designed to be safest for the average sized man."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to like this book. It started out great and with a lot of facts. And then I reached the part about the US tax system and joint tax returns for married couples - and I wanted to scream. The information there was so inaccurate it was downright misinformation. The author doesn't understand the US tax system at all and makes the nonsensical claim that in filing taxes jointly, the lower earner (usually the woman) pays a higher percentage of the tax due. This is wrong on so many levels I can't even. Not how taxes work in the US at all. I was so frustrated by this blatant falsehood I started to question the rest of the book. Now I have no idea if the rest of it is true."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I took about one week to slowly and thoroughly read this book, and it has opened my eyes to many, many different things. This book should be in high school curriculums, maybe then I'd never have to hear another guy tell me about how ""Women just haven't contributed as much to human advancement as men."" Women single handedly created humanity from seeds.And the author does not forget it. This book is absolutely riddled with facts and data, and even the damning lack of data in this context. Its thoughtfully put together to tell the story of 50% of the population that somehow gets treated like a minority. It's often witty, sad, angering, and most of all just depressing. I can't recommend it enough.That said, it was occasionally sprinkled with minor typos, run on sentences got hard to keep up with, and anecdotal evidence was regularly compounded with actual evidence to draw exaggerated conclusions (that were still, on the whole, quite right in their line of thinking.)Read this book if you are a woman or know a woman."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a woman. This highlights things I already knew, and opens my eyes to things I did not know about just how male-biased our culture is.  The gaps in the data are some of the more key components. Partway through, I began to wish for a Mythbusters episode to test the (possible) myth that ""crash test dummies based on the 50th percentile male body adequately test test survival of women with seat belts on,  in car crashes.""  After reading the medical section, I have questions for my doctor about particular courses of treatment. This book asks questions, and notes where answers are unknown, because men are the ""default human."" Fascinating, scary, stunning, and important.  I am recommending this book to everyone I know."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An incredibly inspiring and eye-opening book. As a designer, I am appalled by the lack of female data bias in almost every aspect of everyday life. I encourage everyone to read this, regardless of your career, I believe there is an urgent need for the world to pay more attention to female specific needs."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a book that everyone ought to read and many people will thoroughly enjoy. The topic makes you somewhat frustrated (this is definitely not a feel-good book) and somewhat angry. The data biases go way beyond what I initially expected. The only drawback I have is that it becomes a little preachy in politics and constantly, explicitly hits the same note over and over. At some point you just have to go ""I get it, geez."""
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an informative and very well written book--thoroughly researched, fact-based, and engaging.  I bought a copy for my son and daughter-in-law and recommend the book to friends.  The chapter on medical research data is profound!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Should be required reading for...well, everyone, but especially for anyone wanting to run for political office, leading a company or organization, or otherwise in a position to make decisions that affect the lives of others. Invisible Women makes visible the systemic ways in which women's needs and women's work are ignored in everything from architecture to disaster relief to medicine with results that can be devestating not only for women but for everyone. Stop what you're doing and read now! Then start to make changes."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of the best feminist books I’ve ever read. Not only does it highlight the issues faced by our society in a very thoughtful and thoroughly research manner, but also it provides practical and evidence-based solutions. The author doesn’t merely express frustration towards our society as it is today or place blame on anyone in particular: she does a fantastic job of demonstrating over and over again how debilitating it can be to exclude diverse voices from the conversation when managing the legal, financial, and socio-economic structures of a society. I couldn’t recommend this book more, and I frankly recommend it to everyone."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book opened my eyes in more ways than one being the stereotypical white, entitled male living in the United States. Caroline Criado-Perez thoroughly and expertly relays the facts and the DIRE and extrodinarily unjust and unfair situation faced by women in all cultures all over the world. Half of the population is bring denied just the very basic privileges, rights, and necessary data collection needed to improve society and the human race as a whole by designing everything from politics, humanitarian care, technology, etc to better suit and benefit women. This data gap is a heinous crime against over half the human race and everyone needs to take steps to counteract it and account for these missing data by asking women directly what they want and need. It's NOT a mystery. It's simply laziness, sexism, and tying to mistakenly and incorrectly cut economic costs. Women should not stand to have to be bullied, obsequious, and servile to a patriarchy. They should not have to become more like men to fit in. History does not need any more conformists to the overriding majority in power. If a woman is the kinder, more polite, and moral person in the room, then she deserves to be praised for it by both men and women even if differs from the standard male way of acting and conversing. Men need to do better NOW to be better listeners, be willing to accept women with power, and to never treat them as anything less than an equal human being. Is all this change too much to ask? I don't think so. I think it is the least we can ask and do to progress as a society and grow and prosper as a world that is designed for Women and Men. White heterosexual men have abused there time in power and failed to solve anything. Now it's time to let Women, minorities, and everyone else to rise and create a better world not only for them, but everyone. I am a Sourthern white heterosexual man and that is the stance I support with my writing, voice, and actions."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I think everyone should read this, especially if you are in a leadership position. However, while talking about government, and how they are disproportionately bias towards male, over and over without one good example of a government that is doing something about it. You could mention the small African nation ""Rwanda"" HE Paul Kagame, has done something about it. Just for that I gave it 4 stars."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,This book has a ton of great information but is not a great summer read. Too much information with little entertainment value. Recommend listening to this instead of reading.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book brings together the data that most women experience at some point and most men are unaware of. It demonstrates comprehensively that by treating women as aberrant men we make society more dangerous and difficult for women and children at every level.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,There has been so much science lately regarding medical science only using men in trials.  Science NOW shows male data is far from perfect when it comes to a woman and many of us have died needlessly over the years.  This book will open your eyes and possibly save your life.  Have an honest conversation with your doctor.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A book to make you sad and mad, but mostly more thoughtful than before. Using overwhelming (and concerningly well cited) evidence, Perez makes you confront your own assumptions about how you think about women, women's bodies, women's work, and what it really means to be ""gender neutral"". The solutions she provides evidence of are calls to not just be ""not sexist"". They are calls to be proactively anti-sexist, because anything less proveably doesn't work."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Criado Perez has presented an impressively researched, meticulously sourced* pathway to an unarguable conclusion. It will make you see infrastructure and policies in ways that will upset you, even as you feel at the same time that the horse died around Chapter 10 and the beating continued for six more chapters.* A quarter of the book is endnotes and glossary terms."
,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was recommended this book and I was excited to be presented with a solid proof that has been simply a hunch for me. While there are some good data points and arguments, the argument overall is quite opinionated, and moreover, it has data gaps of its own. Namely, not a single description or example of trans/non-binary issues. The book stands as more of a display of irony than actually delivering on the promise. Huge disappointment."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Data, data, and more data, so if you like numbers, you'll like this book. Upside: there are some interesting and appalling anecdotes"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is well-written, data-driven, and just plain good. It’s amazing to be able to call out all the ways the world - from planning to technology to medicine - is blind to women and their needs. Everyone in every industry should read this and think about what gaps exist and how to fill them. I’m so glad someone wrote this book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"While you may think you know what data bias has done to the female condition, you probably have not experienced the breadth and depth of the research like this. Here it all is, in one place, with surprisingly clear analysis and the data to back it up, framed by science. Everyone needs to read this book."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,An absolute must read for anyone interested in women's rights or human rights. I cannot recommend this book enough. Caroline's strong coherent commentary and evidence for the gender data gap is not only convincing but essential for people to understand.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before this book, I knew the gender gap was real but I was not prepared for the reality of how insidious the problem actually is and how complicit I personally am in perpetuating the “norms” that allow the gap to continue. As Caroline Criado Perez says in the book, “But when your big data is corrupted by big silences, the truths you get are half-truths, at best. And often, for women, they aren’t true at all.” I must do better. We all must do better."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely a book I would recommend to anyone. It’s surprising (and unsettling) how we’re failing to capture the necessary data about 50% of the population to design useful products, make informed decisions, and to save lives.Criado-Perez provides a myriad of examples where gender data gaps are impacting society. While some of her arguments felt like a bit of a stretch, her overall argument was certainly persuasive and eye-opening. A quick and interesting read, this is definitely a book I encourage others to read (repeating myself, I know) as it shines some light on a topic that is clearly needing more attention."
,3.0 out of 5 stars,This book makes some valid points but is so bogged down with data it is very hard to read. It's better skimmed over. I did enjoy the meat of it though.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Informative and well-researched. It stoked my frustration with how the world is designed to meet men's needs and overlooks women (half of the world's population!). This book really displays how deep these issues run in our society.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent book that is making me think we have to redo everything (history, medicine,etc...) accounting for differences by sex and gender."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A fantastically researched, creatively presented, and perspective-shifting work."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,The topic was extremely interesting to me so I grabbed the book. I found it easy to read and well organized. It's an incredibly eye opening read that shines a light on the many ways in which the world does not account for women.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Exposes a huge number of societal issues that slant everything favorable, being studied, being told is ALL slanted towards males."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a great eye-opener and a wonderful reference book with helpful references and data about inequities in so many different settings. It covers the topic with depth and great range. A top read!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A well written book that exposed how much research is based on men’s bodies as a “universal” standard for research. We are NOT the same in so many ways, yet business and government remained biased."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well worth the read for those of us who want to make the world a better place, including for half the world's population - women."
,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an extremely fascinating read. I wish it went more in depth- or had slightly more relatable stories, but I think that probably further showcases how little data is collected on women. Excellent book!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is fantastic! Very well written and researched, exposing the many (albeit not all) challenges that women need to face around the world in our day to day lives. Representation is key so if you are a policy maker, researcher, doctor or tech person, please read the book. We cannot change the past, but we can build a better present and future."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great book.  Repeatedly points out data (or far more often, lack of data) where women are concerned.  It is frightening that women take medicines that are inappropriate (if they work at all), use products that are not safe because they were never designed with women in mind; and are hardly ever consulted about issues that directly concern them."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was your women in gender studies in class not enough? This added logic and perspective to what extends beyond our usual ideas of women's inequality in our global society.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely incredible read. This should be taught as curriculum and required in work trainings. Highly recommend to everyone. Women still have SO FAR TO GO.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just finished the first chapter and have a much better understanding of how women's needs are ignored to society's detriment.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Systematic bias exists which pre-disposes women to wrongful dismissal and inferior quality health care.  This book is a must for any woman or anyone who cares about a woman in seeking adequate healthcare.  This book could save your life.
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book is a must read. I ordered a copy for my sister and have suggested it for everyone who has asked for 2020 reading recommendations. The author cites hundreds of studies from a myriad of disciplines and does so without feeling dry or robotic. If you care about women’s issues, if you have a wife, or a daughter, if you are a woman, heck if you’ve ever met a woman, you need to read this book!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the second copy of Invisible Women that I bought so I could have one for me and one to lend to other people. I am a woman and a designer and I am astounded by the information I discovered in this book. Guess it's my turn to start designing a world for women! Warning: this book will make you hate every man you've ever known and those you don't know
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book should be a mandatory read for every leader, researcher, news reporter, and college professors around the planet!! The way in which facts about women are unnecessarily twisted needs to be known by the entire world. Thank you for your outstanding work!"
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Such a good book.  Everyone, men, women, managers, leaders, anyone who wants to better themselves or society should read it."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book challenges the reader to consider the implications of data, how it is calculated, analyzed and addressed in the real world. I am very thankful to have been recommended this book, it has given me a lot to contemplate especially when addressing problems in my own field. I look forward to reading future works by Caroline Criado Perez."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is just so much in this book that totally blew my mind. This book should be required reading for policymakers, journalists, academics, and businesspeople - everyone, really. A crucially important work. As a bonus, it's also an engaging, extremely readable book as well. Can highly recommend."
,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book talks with facts and numbers about how women are underrepresented, not represented or not even considered in many daily interactions. Transit, medical care, housing are all not Designed with half the population considered."

,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Enlightening, interesting read! The author did an excellent job researching the topics covered and I appreciated that she was not biased in many cases.

,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it so far! Can’t put it down!
,5.0 out of 5 stars,She provides endless examples of how women aren't accounted for and how our world is designed for the default male. Fifty percent of the population should not be treated as a minority. Everyone should read this book.
