Backup is approx 14 to 15 hours easily  in medium volume.. Very fast Bluetooth connectivity and switching.. Type c charging cable.. I think it is best in this Price range."
5,This review i was posted after 1 week using this 1+ bass editions neckband. It's sound quality is awesome bass effect also awesome then call audio quality also super when i receive this project it was 100% changed i was used more then 4 days in this neckband using audio and video player per day i am used 3 hrs approximately after 4 days i got 40% of remaining charger. i changed this neckband with in 10 minutes its fully charged. its worth for money.
5,"I am happy with the product I received.

Good ..."
3,"The microphone is not upto the mark, it doesn't cancel out noise. Rather it only captures the noise rather than the voice. Plus it doesn't support LDAC audios. I would say go for oppo enco m31 if you don't need too much of battery back up. But one plus has got good specs too. It's build quality is great and this is durable. But what is a good earphone without a good mic???"
5,This earphone is good only for music and gaming. The sound quality over call is very poor. The sound is very low for phone calls. Not recommended to purchase if using for good phone call experience
5,"All reviews are accurate but i can't understand why all users gave good reviews about its battery life, i have used various earphones in past such as boat, real me,  oppo, mivi,  all the earphones have very decent even greater battery life to what they claim but seriously guys this earphone have very very poor battry backup compared to other brands earphones,Except battry life all the features are good of this earphone, choose wisely"
5,If you are bass lover don't dare to buy this. Bass is really very bad. I have used Sony earphones and they offer pretty good bass than it. I bought this due to hype but in actuality it's not even close to my expectations. Whenever i listen to music it makes me  ü§¨
5,"This is not a very good product as per brand value and its price bracket. People who have given very good rating perhaps not used any other earphone earlier. I have compared it with my wired Sennheizer earphone which is much better than one plus. Only bass is good in one plus and battery back up as well. I would have gone for boat rather one plus. Investing almost 2k is not worth. It will better to go for boat.Guys one most important thing I wish to add here, please don't trust on YouTube vi..."
4,"1. Call quality is Good. I have tested the call infront of high volume TV. The call was pretty good and didn't hear much noise if TV music. 4.5/52. Music is good. Bass is not as expected. But if you adjust the Equalizer, the Music is good. 4/5.3. Comfort is Pretty good. 5/5.4. Battery is also really good. 5/5."
5,"I've been using this product since last 6 months and i am excited to tell you that this product is worth the price. Its completely water resistant because once i was riding my bike through the city i had this headset worn my neck and it started raining and i was all set including the headset,i thought everything was over since water was everywhere and surpricingly everything works excellent when i connected again after reaching home. Working till now with no issues. Highly Recommended...."

4,Some time audio can be disconnected...Change Audio tract is not working properly...I am so excited with battery life it's was really awesome...Audio and bass quality is not good but it ok... Worthy for this budget...If you need extra bass and extra audio don't choose it with my personal suggestion
5,What a product i ve ever used.i get it on very low price thank u flipkart for the wonderful offer.i have purchase 2 quantity one for my brother also.he is happy with this product.
4,Fast connecting user friendly good battery life studio quality surround quality stereo quality minute sound qualities always very good bass quality average bass uses I am not recommend.
4,"Rich clear sound , don't go for boat if you want a long term product , by spending 700 more get these , boat won't last long , if we tak about bass it's more and real in hd and 4k videos and normal  in low quality video so bass depends on video quality ,saying by testing for 1hour straight from trailers to bass test to songs to movies... Just go it or if your budget is more just go for one plus earbuds for 3k but battery is still in testing mode charged full in 20-30min from 20%to 100 .."
5,Dont buy ...I recommend oppo enco m31 it has more useful features tban this stupid oneplus..my brother bought oppo enco m31.....and its way more useful and better than this...
5,"I have been using it for over 3 months now. My priority is to take calls. Usage - 80% Official calls, 20% regular stuff. I am writing this review after using different brands TWS. I have segregated my points:1. I took it for my office calls as it gives flexibility to move around during lengthy calls. The sound quality is very good. Crisp and clear voice.

5,Sound clarity is too good in comparison of realme wireless and also bass is far better from realme wireless.bass is reaching in the core.
5,Don't buy in Flipkart hated it
4,"Very good product. Sound clarity is fine but due to extra bass some instruments and vocals are faded sometimes! Design and build is good too except there is no cover for the type-c port! Battery backup is too good...no issues there. And comfortable too, itchiness or something like that doesn't happen after using for long hours. Microphone is good, no issues from the other side.

5,Super one plus product
5,Nice
5,Superb bass
5,Compared to OnePlus bullets z this has far better bass and also built quality is good. The sound quality is also good....not as good as LDAC sound system but it is decent overall.
5,Best quality..
5,Suparb
5,Simply outstandingReview after 5days of heavy usageFirst thing to look after when we have earphones like these is battery and it these r fentastic charge for 10mits and it serves you a whole day and even more too.The second best thing is the bass and sound quality and it is simply the best.The next thing is design and pricing. These Bullets reached these specifications too..Overal rating is 10/10 perfect.
4,Oneplus Bullets are probably your best bet at this price range. Amazing sound and bass coverage. However design and fitment is not everyone's cup of tea. For e.g. Atleast for me I find it really hard to get a comfortable position due to there odd shape and it start hurting after few minutes of usage. So if you get chance to try it before you can buy than that would I prefer and recommend. Else you won't be able to enjoy it to full.
5,Super  very very niceüòäüòäüòäüòä
4,Nice
5,What a wonderful headphones üéß thanks flipcart
4,"Should include switch button to switch between devices. The first time a used this, the sound quality was premium . earlier I was using boat rockerz 245.  Yes there is bass to but for maximum effect you have to maximize the volume and you can't stay in this for long then . You Ave to adjust volume and equalisers. Magnetic on/off works very good ."
5,"Supb quality sound and well battery backup... Charging also very fast,,,, love this product"
5,One of the best earphone in Life thank you Flipkart üôè‚ù§Ô∏èüôè‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Bluetooth link breaks very frequently.  Company need to address this issue.
5,Excellent. I love this earphone
5,Very nice earphone only one problem bass batteri back very best and no problem thank for oneplus
4,I have used a lot of Bluetooth neckband earphones but after using OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition for a while now I can surely say that these are the best neckband earphones below 2000 rupees. Build quality is excellent. Material used is very premium. Sound quality is also top notch. Battery life is also very good. Very happy with this product.
4,No doubt this neckband was a beast but reason for giving 4 star is sometimes when I use microphone during games it doesn't work properly my teammates didn't hear me properly BTW it's good choice for me only I face sometimes microphone issue.
5,"This is my second OnePlus Bullets bass edition. Before I used normal edition. I am very much satisfied with this. Best battery backup I got ever, it give 5 to 7 days of backup. Thanks for Best Latency for playing Pubg and other games. I suggest everyone to just try this for once. Thanks OnePlus Never Settle."
5,Sound and bass massive Good battery back upBut one problem in battery consumption battery degrees level 10 percent vise not showing in accurate battery level Over all best value for this prize segment
5,Awesome experience after 1 week Battery backup super Awesome Very nice product
5,"Too good... At last 1+ improved in sound dept. You can feel each and every single note and the most good thing is you can hear tempo in one bud and others in the 2nd bud. I mean, the surround sound sistem is too good"
5,Best and Best Bluetooth Neck Band Headset.It's all in one package.   It's look so nice. Build quality amazing. It's like a rubber. It's so comfortable. Battery backup is awesome. Balanced sound decent bass. Better call quality. It's one plus the brand is enough. Main Features is pairing technology.  It's magnetic. If u join them sound or call is automatically off that nice and also for power saving . When u differ the buds It's automatically and fast connected to call or music.Go for it. Do...

4,good product in bass edition but bass is not comparable with boat...... decent bass available. boat bass is good than one plus . battery life is best. 10 min. of charging gives 10 hrs of playtime
3,Observed a crackling noise for high bass tracks on Mac. It goes away after factor reset but returns after a few tracks/on-off cycles. Works fine on Android & Windows. Mic quality is good and audio is well balanced overall.
4,"review after my 1 week usage.Sound quality is good, battery also good charge for 20 minutes can use for 15 +hours.. Build quality also good...But dont buy it if u are a serious pubg player,  dont know about while using with one plus phones, but while i playing pubg with my redmi note 8 pro i feel the lagOther wise go for it üëçüëçüëç"

5,OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition is the best bluetooth Neckband earphones I have used ever. They are of very high quality and sound output is also very very rich and clear. Its highly recommendable product. Got this in flipkart sale at very good pricing. However it is best wireless earphones priced under 2000. As always received super quick delivery by Ekart executive. Super satisfied with this purchase.
5,After comparison with all neckband I bought this. It was great experience with oneplus. Bass is awesome. You need not to make full volume for deep bass. It shows it‚Äôs class with smaller volume also. Easy pairing. Easy play pause.
5,"Excellent product, but the batter back up is not that much impressive..but Excellent sounds and music.really they have worked up with the bass..built quality is really good.worth every penny..."
5,"My first OnePlus product .I must say this product stands out in delivering good quality mids , highs and lows .I never expected that bass level as I am a bass lover myself and have sony XM4  . This pair of earphones from OnePlus is better than Boat in terms of quality and hardware in this price range.I have not tried realme wireless neckband but definitely the wireless bass z edition is a tough competition to these companies. I have used Boat 225 bluetooth neckband but this one is much better..."
5,Awesome looking and stylish all my friends are asking me for testing this product and some of them are buying. that's batter and I like that thing. Also the phone has low latency mode that's also help me in game overall good performance. Must buy ü§ó

5,"Excellent product, nice bass, loud and clear sound, amazing comfort, super build quality and excellent battery backup... Worth the money."
4,good product in bass edition but bass is not comparable with boat...... decent bass available. boat bass is good than one plus . battery life is best. 10 min. of charging gives 10 hrs of playtime
3,Observed a crackling noise for high bass tracks on Mac. It goes away after factor reset but returns after a few tracks/on-off cycles. Works fine on Android & Windows. Mic quality is good and audio is well balanced overall.
4,"review after my 1 week usage.Sound quality is good, battery also good charge for 20 minutes can use for 15 +hours.. Build quality also good...But dont buy it if u are a serious pubg player,  dont know about while using with one plus phones, but while i playing pubg with my redmi note 8 pro i feel the lagOther wise go for it üëçüëçüëç"
3,The build quality is GoodCharging time and battery backup is excellent.The sound quality is good but the sound clarity is not like a Rs2000 earphone
3,One thing I tell you that it has high bass. Bass lover will love it. But non bass Love it is headache. But sound quality and build quality is outstanding.

5,Awesome Quality Nice Sound & Bass I M Happy With This Product Thank You So Much One Plus & Flipkart
4,Very good sound quality. I am totally satisfied üòÅ
5,Value for money üí∞üí∞ ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èSound is üëåüëå
5,OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition is the best bluetooth Neckband earphones I have used ever. They are of very high quality and sound output is also very very rich and clear. Its highly recommendable product. Got this in flipkart sale at very good pricing. However it is best wireless earphones priced under 2000. As always received super quick delivery by Ekart executive. Super satisfied with this purchase.
5,After comparison with all neckband I bought this. It was great experience with oneplus. Bass is awesome. You need not to make full volume for deep bass. It shows it‚Äôs class with smaller volume also. Easy pairing. Easy play pause.
5,"Excellent product, but the batter back up is not that much impressive..but Excellent sounds and music.really they have worked up with the bass..built quality is really good.worth every penny..."
5,"My first OnePlus product .I must say this product stands out in delivering good quality mids , highs and lows .I never expected that bass level as I am a bass lover myself and have sony XM4  . This pair of earphones from OnePlus is better than Boat in terms of quality and hardware in this price range.I have not tried realme wireless neckband but definitely the wireless bass z edition is a tough competition to these companies. I have used Boat 225 bluetooth neckband but this one is much better..."
5,Awesome looking and stylish all my friends are asking me for testing this product and some of them are buying. that's batter and I like that thing. Also the phone has low latency mode that's also help me in game overall good performance. Must buy ü§ó
5,happy For Good Service provided by flipkart..! Product is very good and having good Battery life..! Go for it in offer o got in Rs. 1699/-
4,The collar and wire quality is good. Battery back up is bang on I mean I'm using it in my day to day calls and videos and it easily work for 8-10 hours on heavy usage. One thing that is missing is quick switch. I'm using the OP buds as well and quick switch on them works like magic to switch between devices.
3,Product is good but as the name says baas edition it has not such a good bass but its decent sound quality is good but bass is not so satisfying
3,"Bass is not that smooth nor a destroyer to the ears. It is a blend of decent bass.I dont like the bass performance but the overall make, fit and finish is good. Built Quality is good. The higher variant of the Oneplus Wireless Bullets 2 are way too good than this product in terms of sound and quality.At this price point of Rs. 1799, this is not the best product. It sounds like a Rs. 1000 product which are also available on flipkart with different branding."
3,"Last version of one plus eaephones was more technologically advanced, this one has got all the good features except for the swap switch where just by pressing the button i could pair with different devices.Not so happy with it, also the battery back up is less compared to previous version of this.However its not that great nor is it too bad. Nothing so cool, its similar to realme or mi earphones."
5,Best earphone ever seen before
5,"Been using this for over 2 months now....Amazing product.... Totally worth it, connects very quickly without any effort which is very helpful.... Charges quickly.... The material used is soft bendable and comfortable.... Also water resistant which is reliable.... Although I am not satisfied by its range but still, Ill definitely recommend this product üòç‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,Awesome product....... sounds very clearly and have a good look ....
5,"Sound quality is good, the bass thump is great! Instrument separation, sound clarity and soundstage is above average at this price point. The main highlight is the battery life. I have been using it for 2 weeks now, and it lasts around 15 hours on single full charge, and takes only 10 min to get charged to 70 80 % which indeed gives battery backup as claimed for 9 to 10 hrs. It also is somewhat on the comfortable side and very lightweight. Overall a great product considering the price point."
3,While watching online videos in you tube and listening to songs a weird sound like connection problem happens .
5,Got delivered within 14hrs only super fast delivery from Flipkart even in this lockdown period.Using earphone continuously from last 15 days awesome sound quality super bass and a good battery life. Earphone get charged within 20 mins only and last almost 15-20 hours. If you are using it for taking calls then go for it it suppress 90-95% of background noise even when i took a call while driving there is no complaint from 2nd party of background noise. Best earphone under 2-4k.

5,Do not buyCalling with my bullets z bass edition connected via bluetooth cause a buzzing noise which can be heard by the other person. This goes away if I switch to phone or speaker mode so its obviously an earphone or bluetooth issue. Also I cannot hear the noise but the person on the other end of the call hears it. This dosen't happen while listening to music. Resetting the earphones sometimes works for sometime but then the issue occurs randomly again.
5,I loved it..

5,Worst product in this price segment. I'm using this product for last 2 weeks and now I'm facing 2 major issue with this product that is-1. Connectivity issue- auto disconnect device and once you off Bluetooth then it's very tough to pair again2. Battery Back up - In normal use 6 hours maximum.I suggest don't waste your money  to buy this product
4,It sometimes  mutes the voice its not videos or audio problem its a oneplus Headset Problrm . I am irrigated and unhappy

5,"I had bullet wireless z first edition, now switched to z bass edition. One notable difference is, while on call during bike ride with old z ppl complained about wind blowing sound and it really affected the quality but now the person on the other end is not complaining the same. I thought the replacement of mic from the wire will affect the quality of the call but surprisingly it only increased the quality. And about bass i can feel a notable amount of difference. Now the bass is more awesome..."

High Volume on this product is not needed for Loud experience.Initial Impression is Simply Wow... Don't even think for second opinion about the bass edition.

5,"Product is good, sound quality, design, build and battery backup is good. The only thing is missing dual pairing which they have given in first headphone. Don't understand 1+ logic of removing switch button from this headphones. I find it good for calling when connected from mobile. However, I wouldn't recommend for GTM / Laptop meetings."

5,I really don't understand why this magnetic power on and off is inbuilt when maximum backup is only one day. Its useless feature as of mine. There is a connectivity issue becoz of this magnetic power on off. Battery backup is very poor when compared to other bluetooth headphones. Earpods also not comfortable. Voice is echoing when hearing because of closed earpods

But I'have  give one start becoz of not connecting properly to mobiles.. it's automatically disconnected while call. Not able to exchange in flipkart.

5,Got a defective product. Bluetooth gets disconnected automatically.
5,"This product is useless to buy. Within week there is static notice while on call and you can't do anything to fix it. It's manufacturing , compatibility issues with bass edition. I need this to be replaced with basic edition."

5,Supper
3,Very good
5,Very comfortable.Design is good but I was a bit unsatisfied with the position of the control part but after some use I became used to that. Bass is more than that of it's previous version but not like in a wired headset. 8hr continuous working after full charge and taking 40min to full charge after complete discharge.
5,Bass is really awesome n heavy which obviously it's point of selling....this can handle higher bass songs without any tearing up of sound.... battery would have been much better....they claim 17 hrs battery backup but practically it lasts 12-13 hrs .....would recommend everyone to burn these for 2-3 hrs before putting it on...... rating 4/5.
5,"Value for money....Decent sound and bass of the productOverall satisfied with my purchase""Value for money product """

5,Awesome
3,Although it's a good gadget as far as earphones goes the one major flaw is we can't change songs using volume buttons......Which is basically the biggest boon of using any bluetooth earphones....So when we are doing something and wanna change the track we have no choice but to do it using our phone ......which in my opinion sucks.....When you have to do it using the phone anyway what's the upside of having a bluetooth earphone ....even a cheap quality 50 rupees wired earphone have the same...

So if and one want to buy it you can buy it. But for calling purpose it is waste. Better you can buy oppo Enco M31  will be the best option for all purpose.But only 8 hrs play back time.

And the call quality is not out of the box. The voice over the call gets a bit like disconnected.                  Overally the product is good but it is not a 100%                 I would give it a 85 our of 100.                                 ..."

4,Very good but
5,I would admire the sound qualities are really that boosting. But I want to tell something about the bassI found somewhere that this bass boosting feature is somehow affecting the mid or high mid sounds. Overall boosting sound.But I will suggest Realme Neckband as that product costs lower than this and the sound quality is not that different.

I listen to a lot of different genres (EDM, Hip Hop, Pop, Rock and Metal) and have no issues. It just sounds perfect no matter which song you throw at it. Talking about bass, it is there and provides a powerful thump but in no way is overpowering. It's not like other earphones in this range where it's only bass. In a nutshell, awesome sound and very happy..."

5,"If you are looking for quick switch feature of one plus bulletz then go with the regular variant instead of this bass edition. One plus description says that it works differently but for all practical purposes it is not there. It says that we need to switch by going on the bluetooth setting which totally defeats the purpose of quick switch. Don't be mislead, because if you order this product in error thinking that it has quick switch feature then you won't be able to return it as flipkart..."

3,"1. The mic is quite noisy when taking a call. You hear a constant flickering sound when you are on a call and the person on the other end can hear the same which doesn't allow you to take a call through these pair of earphones.2. It turns off when it's on charge, which means that you cannot use it while it's charging.In all other departments like build, battery and sound however, it works just perfectly!"
4,"Sir or Ma'am, the Sony can't compete with this one.. I have the sony headphone also, but this one sound's good..I have used so much wireless headphones, so many different brands also, but no one can compete with this one.. The Deep Bass really feels in our ears...just loved it.. For the bass the 5 Star is not enough... üòçüòç"
