5,"This is my first OnePlus product and now I'm in love with these. Superb sound quality and build is great. And yeah, I'm enjoying music alot."
5,"I've been using this product for the last 3 days. This might be too early to write an elaborate review but I've known enough about this neckband to be ""eligible"".1. Sound Quality: The drivers definitely produce a very balanced sound that is surely going to satisfy most of the people including me. Whether it's about mid frequencies, vocals or the high frequency trebles, or even the lower frequencies, this neckband deals all of those with superior performance. Undoubtedly.2. Bass: Bass is..."
5,Awesome product..... With a super deep bass and excellent charging capacity... I loved it♥♥
5,Very nice product with amazing battery back up and deep bass.. Awsome sound clarity.it is very flexible  Length of wire is little low.
5,"Some ones are still telling there is no Bass. Actually this wireless headset bass is awesome. Getting a well balanced sound with bass boosted ♥️Battery backup is beast. Nothing to say🔥About microphone, this is good but no noise cancellation. Catches all the sound.😒Design wise it's ultra beast. More flexible.🙂One thing is don't lost the tag in the neckband. Keep it safely for warranty claim✅*writing this thing using 3 days. i will keep updating about my using experience"
5,🎶🎶Used since 8 days Bass is good ✌Sound quality is simply amazing👌Battery backup is awesome 🤟🤟10 hour backup in in 10 min charge Comfortable wearing Also fitting in neck Overall nice product 👍
5,"Amazing product...Super quick connectivity, so far i didn't have any connection drop...The band is super soft and you can keep it in your pocket very easly...Sound quality is amazingAnd yesss bass is also great for norml humans..I listen music at 70% volume and even than bass is ama, ing vocals are clearAnd at 100% you can even sit in auto and can listen to your favourite music...Go for it without second thought"
5,"Excellent quality.. Packing is awesome.. Neckband quality is impressive its very Soft rubber, light weight.. Sound quality is very nice.. And bass is impressive.. Backup is approx 14 to 15 hours easily  in medium volume.. Very fast Bluetooth connectivity and switching.. Type c charging cable.. I think it is best in this Price range."
5,This review i was posted after 1 week using this 1+ bass editions neckband. It's sound quality is awesome bass effect also awesome then call audio quality also super when i receive this project it was 100% changed i was used more then 4 days in this neckband using audio and video player per day i am used 3 hrs approximately after 4 days i got 40% of remaining charger. i changed this neckband with in 10 minutes its fully charged. its worth for money.
5,"I am happy with the product I received. Packed tightly and got genuine product.This is after 10days review.I charged for 3time only- battery backup really niceNo irritation at all while placingThere is no noise cancellation i think but voice will be clear for receiving personSounds are really amazing I will re edit again after 20daysDesign, build quality is nice and I don't feel wires will sustain for long periods use.No irritation even after placing it for 10hrs.Nice one... Good ..."
3,"The microphone is not upto the mark, it doesn't cancel out noise. Rather it only captures the noise rather than the voice. Plus it doesn't support LDAC audios. I would say go for oppo enco m31 if you don't need too much of battery back up. But one plus has got good specs too. It's build quality is great and this is durable. But what is a good earphone without a good mic???"
5,This earphone is good only for music and gaming. The sound quality over call is very poor. The sound is very low for phone calls. Not recommended to purchase if using for good phone call experience
5,"All reviews are accurate but i can't understand why all users gave good reviews about its battery life, i have used various earphones in past such as boat, real me,  oppo, mivi,  all the earphones have very decent even greater battery life to what they claim but seriously guys this earphone have very very poor battry backup compared to other brands earphones,Except battry life all the features are good of this earphone, choose wisely"
5,If you are bass lover don't dare to buy this. Bass is really very bad. I have used Sony earphones and they offer pretty good bass than it. I bought this due to hype but in actuality it's not even close to my expectations. Whenever i listen to music it makes me  🤬
5,"This is not a very good product as per brand value and its price bracket. People who have given very good rating perhaps not used any other earphone earlier. I have compared it with my wired Sennheizer earphone which is much better than one plus. Only bass is good in one plus and battery back up as well. I would have gone for boat rather one plus. Investing almost 2k is not worth. It will better to go for boat.Guys one most important thing I wish to add here, please don't trust on YouTube vi..."
4,"1. Call quality is Good. I have tested the call infront of high volume TV. The call was pretty good and didn't hear much noise if TV music. 4.5/52. Music is good. Bass is not as expected. But if you adjust the Equalizer, the Music is good. 4/5.3. Comfort is Pretty good. 5/5.4. Battery is also really good. 5/5."
5,"I've been using this product since last 6 months and i am excited to tell you that this product is worth the price. Its completely water resistant because once i was riding my bike through the city i had this headset worn my neck and it started raining and i was all set including the headset,i thought everything was over since water was everywhere and surpricingly everything works excellent when i connected again after reaching home. Working till now with no issues. Highly Recommended...."
5,"Very nice product in this priceBass, sound quality is very good 🎧😍Battery backup is also good 🤩The packing of product is  good📦📦Overall good product"
5,One plus wirless blutooth hetset is very good I like the product I am waiting for 5month's the one plus blutooth hatset parchash so happy 😊🤭❤️ thank you for flipkart 🎈🔥
4,Some time audio can be disconnected...Change Audio tract is not working properly...I am so excited with battery life it's was really awesome...Audio and bass quality is not good but it ok... Worthy for this budget...If you need extra bass and extra audio don't choose it with my personal suggestion
5,What a product i ve ever used.i get it on very low price thank u flipkart for the wonderful offer.i have purchase 2 quantity one for my brother also.he is happy with this product.
4,Fast connecting user friendly good battery life studio quality surround quality stereo quality minute sound qualities always very good bass quality average bass uses I am not recommend.
4,"Rich clear sound , don't go for boat if you want a long term product , by spending 700 more get these , boat won't last long , if we tak about bass it's more and real in hd and 4k videos and normal  in low quality video so bass depends on video quality ,saying by testing for 1hour straight from trailers to bass test to songs to movies... Just go it or if your budget is more just go for one plus earbuds for 3k but battery is still in testing mode charged full in 20-30min from 20%to 100 .."
5,Dont buy ...I recommend oppo enco m31 it has more useful features tban this stupid oneplus..my brother bought oppo enco m31.....and its way more useful and better than this...
5,"I have been using it for over 3 months now. My priority is to take calls. Usage - 80% Official calls, 20% regular stuff. I am writing this review after using different brands TWS. I have segregated my points:1. I took it for my office calls as it gives flexibility to move around during lengthy calls. The sound quality is very good. Crisp and clear voice. The caller on the other side doesnt even come to know that we are using bluetooth device instead of wired headphones.2. Sound quality is v..."
5,Okey quality !!But lots of features!!
5,After use of 1 week i am writing this review and after searching for 6 months almost I bought this hands-free. My first priority was good battery backup which completely ful fill with this product. And also nice sound quality. Product delivered before time so thank for that.
4,Bought these headphones 3 weeks backPros:1. excellent build quality2. Great bass and sound3. light weight and handy4. gives me 10hrs of battery back up5. really good quick chargeCons:1. Missing quick switch button
5,Sound clarity is too good in comparison of realme wireless and also bass is far better from realme wireless.bass is reaching in the core.
5,Don't buy in Flipkart hated it
4,"Very good product. Sound clarity is fine but due to extra bass some instruments and vocals are faded sometimes! Design and build is good too except there is no cover for the type-c port! Battery backup is too good...no issues there. And comfortable too, itchiness or something like that doesn't happen after using for long hours. Microphone is good, no issues from the other side.

4,Buy without any second thought just bought it and the sound quality is pretty darn good the bass is also good but not as punchy as realmebuds wireless but the bass is present and it's awesome the balanced sound quality is op
5,Super one plus product
5,Nice
5,Superb bass
5,Compared to OnePlus bullets z this has far better bass and also built quality is good. The sound quality is also good....not as good as LDAC sound system but it is decent overall.
5,Best quality..
5,Suparb
5,Simply outstandingReview after 5days of heavy usageFirst thing to look after when we have earphones like these is battery and it these r fentastic charge for 10mits and it serves you a whole day and even more too.The second best thing is the bass and sound quality and it is simply the best.The next thing is design and pricing. These Bullets reached these specifications too..Overal rating is 10/10 perfect.
4,Oneplus Bullets are probably your best bet at this price range. Amazing sound and bass coverage. However design and fitment is not everyone's cup of tea. For e.g. Atleast for me I find it really hard to get a comfortable position due to there odd shape and it start hurting after few minutes of usage. So if you get chance to try it before you can buy than that would I prefer and recommend. Else you won't be able to enjoy it to full.
5,Super  very very nice😊😊😊😊
4,Nice
5,What a wonderful headphones 🎧 thanks flipcart
4,"Should include switch button to switch between devices. The first time a used this, the sound quality was premium . earlier I was using boat rockerz 245.  Yes there is bass to but for maximum effect you have to maximize the volume and you can't stay in this for long then . You Ave to adjust volume and equalisers. Magnetic on/off works very good ."
5,"Supb quality sound and well battery backup... Charging also very fast,,,, love this product"
5,One of the best earphone in Life thank you Flipkart 🙏❤️🙏❤️
5,Bluetooth link breaks very frequently.  Company need to address this issue.
5,Excellent. I love this earphone
5,Very nice earphone only one problem bass batteri back very best and no problem thank for oneplus
4,I have used a lot of Bluetooth neckband earphones but after using OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition for a while now I can surely say that these are the best neckband earphones below 2000 rupees. Build quality is excellent. Material used is very premium. Sound quality is also top notch. Battery life is also very good. Very happy with this product.
4,No doubt this neckband was a beast but reason for giving 4 star is sometimes when I use microphone during games it doesn't work properly my teammates didn't hear me properly BTW it's good choice for me only I face sometimes microphone issue.
5,"This is my second OnePlus Bullets bass edition. Before I used normal edition. I am very much satisfied with this. Best battery backup I got ever, it give 5 to 7 days of backup. Thanks for Best Latency for playing Pubg and other games. I suggest everyone to just try this for once. Thanks OnePlus Never Settle."
5,Sound and bass massive Good battery back upBut one problem in battery consumption battery degrees level 10 percent vise not showing in accurate battery level Over all best value for this prize segment
5,Awesome experience after 1 week Battery backup super Awesome Very nice product
5,"Too good... At last 1+ improved in sound dept. You can feel each and every single note and the most good thing is you can hear tempo in one bud and others in the 2nd bud. I mean, the surround sound sistem is too good"
5,Best and Best Bluetooth Neck Band Headset.It's all in one package.   It's look so nice. Build quality amazing. It's like a rubber. It's so comfortable. Battery backup is awesome. Balanced sound decent bass. Better call quality. It's one plus the brand is enough. Main Features is pairing technology.  It's magnetic. If u join them sound or call is automatically off that nice and also for power saving . When u differ the buds It's automatically and fast connected to call or music.Go for it. Do...

5,"Excellent product, nice bass, loud and clear sound, amazing comfort, super build quality and excellent battery backup... Worth the money."
4,good product in bass edition but bass is not comparable with boat...... decent bass available. boat bass is good than one plus . battery life is best. 10 min. of charging gives 10 hrs of playtime
3,Observed a crackling noise for high bass tracks on Mac. It goes away after factor reset but returns after a few tracks/on-off cycles. Works fine on Android & Windows. Mic quality is good and audio is well balanced overall.
4,"review after my 1 week usage.Sound quality is good, battery also good charge for 20 minutes can use for 15 +hours.. Build quality also good...But dont buy it if u are a serious pubg player,  dont know about while using with one plus phones, but while i playing pubg with my redmi note 8 pro i feel the lagOther wise go for it 👍👍👍"
3,The build quality is GoodCharging time and battery backup is excellent.The sound quality is good but the sound clarity is not like a Rs2000 earphone
3,One thing I tell you that it has high bass. Bass lover will love it. But non bass Love it is headache. But sound quality and build quality is outstanding.

5,Awesome Quality Nice Sound & Bass I M Happy With This Product Thank You So Much One Plus & Flipkart
4,Very good sound quality. I am totally satisfied 😁
5,Value for money 💰💰 ❤️❤️Sound is 👌👌
5,OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition is the best bluetooth Neckband earphones I have used ever. They are of very high quality and sound output is also very very rich and clear. Its highly recommendable product. Got this in flipkart sale at very good pricing. However it is best wireless earphones priced under 2000. As always received super quick delivery by Ekart executive. Super satisfied with this purchase.
5,After comparison with all neckband I bought this. It was great experience with oneplus. Bass is awesome. You need not to make full volume for deep bass. It shows it’s class with smaller volume also. Easy pairing. Easy play pause.
5,"Excellent product, but the batter back up is not that much impressive..but Excellent sounds and music.really they have worked up with the bass..built quality is really good.worth every penny..."
5,"My first OnePlus product .I must say this product stands out in delivering good quality mids , highs and lows .I never expected that bass level as I am a bass lover myself and have sony XM4  . This pair of earphones from OnePlus is better than Boat in terms of quality and hardware in this price range.I have not tried realme wireless neckband but definitely the wireless bass z edition is a tough competition to these companies. I have used Boat 225 bluetooth neckband but this one is much better..."
5,Awesome looking and stylish all my friends are asking me for testing this product and some of them are buying. that's batter and I like that thing. Also the phone has low latency mode that's also help me in game overall good performance. Must buy 🤗

5,"One of the best headphones .I have ever usedSound quality is ok , if are a bass lover just go for it Otherwise for sound quality u may choose JBL or Sony xdr series headphone , this headphone has the best build quality , battery backup is stunning From my view I will give 95/100 points"
4,"Super delivery within one day. Thaks for the filpkart delivery. Best value for price. Durable product. If u looking for a standard bluetooth headset, then go for it"
5,Good sound effectBattery backup is super and bass is excellent worth of rate in this productAwesome 👍
5,Very good product this price range
4,I have been using then for more than 13 days now and I think it's a good time to tell what i think about them.VOCALS AND SOUND QUALITY are simply superb you can here even the smallest sounds very clearly and BASS is good but it's not very much high.Build Quality is very good you can use it for hours and won't even feel them they are light and material quality is good.CONNECTIVITY is also very good.BATTERY BACKUP is EXCELLENT you can use them for 2 days on a single charge and charges very ...
5,"Excellent product, nice bass, loud and clear sound, amazing comfort, super build quality and excellent battery backup... Worth the money."
4,good product in bass edition but bass is not comparable with boat...... decent bass available. boat bass is good than one plus . battery life is best. 10 min. of charging gives 10 hrs of playtime
3,Observed a crackling noise for high bass tracks on Mac. It goes away after factor reset but returns after a few tracks/on-off cycles. Works fine on Android & Windows. Mic quality is good and audio is well balanced overall.
4,"review after my 1 week usage.Sound quality is good, battery also good charge for 20 minutes can use for 15 +hours.. Build quality also good...But dont buy it if u are a serious pubg player,  dont know about while using with one plus phones, but while i playing pubg with my redmi note 8 pro i feel the lagOther wise go for it 👍👍👍"
3,The build quality is GoodCharging time and battery backup is excellent.The sound quality is good but the sound clarity is not like a Rs2000 earphone
3,One thing I tell you that it has high bass. Bass lover will love it. But non bass Love it is headache. But sound quality and build quality is outstanding.

5,Awesome Quality Nice Sound & Bass I M Happy With This Product Thank You So Much One Plus & Flipkart
4,Very good sound quality. I am totally satisfied 😁
5,Value for money 💰💰 ❤️❤️Sound is 👌👌
5,OnePlus Bullets Z Bass Edition is the best bluetooth Neckband earphones I have used ever. They are of very high quality and sound output is also very very rich and clear. Its highly recommendable product. Got this in flipkart sale at very good pricing. However it is best wireless earphones priced under 2000. As always received super quick delivery by Ekart executive. Super satisfied with this purchase.
5,After comparison with all neckband I bought this. It was great experience with oneplus. Bass is awesome. You need not to make full volume for deep bass. It shows it’s class with smaller volume also. Easy pairing. Easy play pause.
5,"Excellent product, but the batter back up is not that much impressive..but Excellent sounds and music.really they have worked up with the bass..built quality is really good.worth every penny..."
5,"My first OnePlus product .I must say this product stands out in delivering good quality mids , highs and lows .I never expected that bass level as I am a bass lover myself and have sony XM4  . This pair of earphones from OnePlus is better than Boat in terms of quality and hardware in this price range.I have not tried realme wireless neckband but definitely the wireless bass z edition is a tough competition to these companies. I have used Boat 225 bluetooth neckband but this one is much better..."
5,Awesome looking and stylish all my friends are asking me for testing this product and some of them are buying. that's batter and I like that thing. Also the phone has low latency mode that's also help me in game overall good performance. Must buy 🤗
5,happy For Good Service provided by flipkart..! Product is very good and having good Battery life..! Go for it in offer o got in Rs. 1699/-
4,The collar and wire quality is good. Battery back up is bang on I mean I'm using it in my day to day calls and videos and it easily work for 8-10 hours on heavy usage. One thing that is missing is quick switch. I'm using the OP buds as well and quick switch on them works like magic to switch between devices.
3,Product is good but as the name says baas edition it has not such a good bass but its decent sound quality is good but bass is not so satisfying
3,"Bass is not that smooth nor a destroyer to the ears. It is a blend of decent bass.I dont like the bass performance but the overall make, fit and finish is good. Built Quality is good. The higher variant of the Oneplus Wireless Bullets 2 are way too good than this product in terms of sound and quality.At this price point of Rs. 1799, this is not the best product. It sounds like a Rs. 1000 product which are also available on flipkart with different branding."
3,"Last version of one plus eaephones was more technologically advanced, this one has got all the good features except for the swap switch where just by pressing the button i could pair with different devices.Not so happy with it, also the battery back up is less compared to previous version of this.However its not that great nor is it too bad. Nothing so cool, its similar to realme or mi earphones."
5,Best earphone ever seen before
5,"Been using this for over 2 months now....Amazing product.... Totally worth it, connects very quickly without any effort which is very helpful.... Charges quickly.... The material used is soft bendable and comfortable.... Also water resistant which is reliable.... Although I am not satisfied by its range but still, Ill definitely recommend this product 😍❤️"
5,Awesome product....... sounds very clearly and have a good look ....
5,"Sound quality is good, the bass thump is great! Instrument separation, sound clarity and soundstage is above average at this price point. The main highlight is the battery life. I have been using it for 2 weeks now, and it lasts around 15 hours on single full charge, and takes only 10 min to get charged to 70 80 % which indeed gives battery backup as claimed for 9 to 10 hrs. It also is somewhat on the comfortable side and very lightweight. Overall a great product considering the price point."
3,While watching online videos in you tube and listening to songs a weird sound like connection problem happens .
5,Got delivered within 14hrs only super fast delivery from Flipkart even in this lockdown period.Using earphone continuously from last 15 days awesome sound quality super bass and a good battery life. Earphone get charged within 20 mins only and last almost 15-20 hours. If you are using it for taking calls then go for it it suppress 90-95% of background noise even when i took a call while driving there is no complaint from 2nd party of background noise. Best earphone under 2-4k.
5,Nice

4,I'm loving this bluetooth ☺️😍
5,Best sound & bass quality
5,Gd quality
5,Do not buyCalling with my bullets z bass edition connected via bluetooth cause a buzzing noise which can be heard by the other person. This goes away if I switch to phone or speaker mode so its obviously an earphone or bluetooth issue. Also I cannot hear the noise but the person on the other end of the call hears it. This dosen't happen while listening to music. Resetting the earphones sometimes works for sometime but then the issue occurs randomly again.
5,I loved it..
5,Good product. Must buy
5,Luv the packaging ....nd absolutely imaging sound quality ....🥰thank u flipkart
4,"Good battery back up, sound should be improved"
5,OsM Baas .....I Have Been Using for 30 Days.....I always sleep around the night in my neck....No Defect No Damage.....Battery Backup 2 Days.....Charged in 15-20 mins....Magnetic Buds.....Charging Light (Red)After Charged Light (White)Premium Quality.....Noise Cancellation....

4,Supar
5,I bought this 5 months ago and after sometime it stopped working the quality of sound  was not satisfactory they are just selling on a brand name plz think 100 times before buying these worthless earphones instead go for sony they are far better in every perspective
5,Replced item was has the same issue not satisfied.... Very bad
5,Suparb
5,Not connecting
5,Mic is not working within one month of purchase.  Irritating noise comes from earphones. Worst decision of life to purchase OnePlus Bullets Z Bass edition.
5,Very nice
5,Worst product in this price segment. I'm using this product for last 2 weeks and now I'm facing 2 major issue with this product that is-1. Connectivity issue- auto disconnect device and once you off Bluetooth then it's very tough to pair again2. Battery Back up - In normal use 6 hours maximum.I suggest don't waste your money  to buy this product
4,It sometimes  mutes the voice its not videos or audio problem its a oneplus Headset Problrm . I am irrigated and unhappy
5,Coming from the Sony mdr-xb55ap I know I'm going to be disappointed so nothing new just using it for voice calls. Damn this has fake bass sorry oneplus fans
4,Nice product
3,"Good earphones but the volume level percentages are like 10,20,30,60,70,80,100%(missing 40,50,90%)Except this everything is fine..build and sound quality is very good. You won't regret after buying.q"

3,Base is not good sound is ok ok
5,Superb in this price range just loved it ☺️
5,Disegine best battery backup is good 12-14hour backup
5,"I had bullet wireless z first edition, now switched to z bass edition. One notable difference is, while on call during bike ride with old z ppl complained about wind blowing sound and it really affected the quality but now the person on the other end is not complaining the same. I thought the replacement of mic from the wire will affect the quality of the call but surprisingly it only increased the quality. And about bass i can feel a notable amount of difference. Now the bass is more awesome..."
4,Awesome love it ❤️ value for money product 🔥 just go for it🤗my review after using 5 days no issue upto now sounds quality bass design I am 101% satisfied with this bass edition
5,Nice Bass Nice Sound and built quality
5,The red and black mixed design is awesome.good bass ..I really love it.

5,Connectivity issue
5,My friend was shocked with this sound.its amezing
5,I was So Confused to buy the Normal version and Bass edition.But i am completely Happy with the Bass edition.Awesome Sound Quality and Bass....Low Latency compared to Any others on this price range.Latency is never experienced.Battery Backup is Extremely High. High Volume on this product is not needed for Loud experience.Initial Impression is Simply Wow... Don't even think for second opinion about the bass edition.
5,Amazing head phone battery is superb bass is superb
4,"I think call quality is decent when you are in indoor, could be difficult to hear outdoor sometimes..but regarding this everything is upto the mark.I almost forgot to tell you one thing..(there is issue regarding charging indicator not turning white on 100% ) but tbh not charge it more than 20-30mins."
5,"Product is good, sound quality, design, build and battery backup is good. The only thing is missing dual pairing which they have given in first headphone. Don't understand 1+ logic of removing switch button from this headphones. I find it good for calling when connected from mobile. However, I wouldn't recommend for GTM / Laptop meetings."
5,"OnePlus bullet wireless Z bass edition is awesome sound quality ,bass, battery backup is very very super 🔥🔥🔥🔥,Better than realme buds wireless bluetooth earphones and boat rockerz 255 pro and pro +"
5,Producing noise while calling... Not clear earable earable..... Return exchange is to late....
5,Nice 👌 product
5,Worst
5,I really don't understand why this magnetic power on and off is inbuilt when maximum backup is only one day. Its useless feature as of mine. There is a connectivity issue becoz of this magnetic power on off. Battery backup is very poor when compared to other bluetooth headphones. Earpods also not comfortable. Voice is echoing when hearing because of closed earpods
3,on and off button not working properly
4,nice product
5,Excellent bass 👌 super sounds great feeling 👍 nice product 😊😘
3,Not reached as my expectations sometimes there is a sound problem

5,"Full change in 1 hour , real backup is approx 18 hour"
5,Sound quality is super..
5,No doubt the sound is brilliant but the quality is not upto the mark as I can show you in this pic where you can find that the volume button is totally out from the neckband within two month of normal use. Image upload showing failed don't know the reason behind it.....
5,I'm the user of OnePlus from last 10 months. It was good. That's why I have ordered it for my frnd. But I'have  give one start becoz of not connecting properly to mobiles.. it's automatically disconnected while call. Not able to exchange in flipkart. We need to go the one plus store for repairing this. It's totally disappointed. We can't go to the store directly that's why we are ordering from online. If any  connectivity issues in this product flipkart will not be take exchange. This is tota...
4,"Super product ,blind fold purchase ,ultimate quality and worth it ,loved it with honest review"
5,"Not sure about battery backup but other things are definitely fine. There are some people who are criticising, must be a BOSE fan but they can't afford, so same expecting from 2000 Rs earphone. Trust me, go for it without any doubt. It's fine!"
5,Got a defective product. Bluetooth gets disconnected automatically.
5,"This product is useless to buy. Within week there is static notice while on call and you can't do anything to fix it. It's manufacturing , compatibility issues with bass edition. I need this to be replaced with basic edition."
4,Can't speak in phone call
4,Sound prblm
5,Good
4,After 1 month the call mic is not working
5,Very Bad Calling features

5,"Specially the battery backup I loved it, the sound quality is also great , little but low in bass perforamanceReally it 10min charge 10 hrs performanceI brougt it at rs 1494."
5,Supper
3,Very good
5,Very comfortable.Design is good but I was a bit unsatisfied with the position of the control part but after some use I became used to that. Bass is more than that of it's previous version but not like in a wired headset. 8hr continuous working after full charge and taking 40min to full charge after complete discharge.
5,Bass is really awesome n heavy which obviously it's point of selling....this can handle higher bass songs without any tearing up of sound.... battery would have been much better....they claim 17 hrs battery backup but practically it lasts 12-13 hrs .....would recommend everyone to burn these for 2-3 hrs before putting it on...... rating 4/5.
5,"Value for money....Decent sound and bass of the productOverall satisfied with my purchase""Value for money product """
5,Nice .......Owesome ...Nice Product .....

5,After 10 months of usage..👌
5,Awesome sound Quality 😍😍
5,"Highly recommended. Perfect Bluetooth connection without any problem. Value for money. Of course boat headset are very good. But this oneplus z bass edition can beat any company's neckband. Don't think too much, if you want to buy Bluetooth earphones please go for it without any hesitation. Such a wonderful product from oneplus"

5,"It is the best neckband I have ever purchased under 2k. It has loudness and richness in its sound. It is very light weight feels no weight in neck. In ear fitting is also awesome. According to me, after comparing all other neckband, I arrived at this conclusion that it is the best."

5,"Build quality is good, but earphone is not good. Main thing in earphone is its sound quality, every where is paid reviews, on youtube they will try to compare it with boat n oppo only, why not they buy any other earphone and compare because they are not paid. 700rs earphone performs well as compared to this"

5,"Great product, amazing sound quality. Battery backup is best in class. Can go for this without second thoughts."
5,Awesome
3,Although it's a good gadget as far as earphones goes the one major flaw is we can't change songs using volume buttons......Which is basically the biggest boon of using any bluetooth earphones....So when we are doing something and wanna change the track we have no choice but to do it using our phone ......which in my opinion sucks.....When you have to do it using the phone anyway what's the upside of having a bluetooth earphone ....even a cheap quality 50 rupees wired earphone have the same...

4,"Not working for calls, getting extra noise in calls, very costly with no basic quality"
5,Best products
4,Over all product is nice.But noise cancellation is worst.For online classes and for music purpose this earphone is very nice and while listening music we can hear every instrument sound very clearly. So if and one want to buy it you can buy it. But for calling purpose it is waste. Better you can buy oppo Enco M31  will be the best option for all purpose.But only 8 hrs play back time. You can ask your doubts in instagram
5,Good

5,"Sound quality, bass great unbelivalable super bass all is good"
5,"Over all good experience in this price range.Giving this review after using 3 months. Battery 🔋 is amazingly long lasts for atleast 2 days with almost 10 hrs of heavy usage. I usually charge it for just 5 minutes and 1 days full use is enough.Music 🎵 is also power-packed. With this price range i quite shocked first that one plus can give this type of sound. Usually i found this type of sound and clearity in higher range with premium brands like Audio technica, AKG, Marshalls and B&O's ..."
5,Very good product
5,Best wireless head phone...No any problem...in this Go for it...Thanks flipkart ...Osmm.. product
5,Automatic disconnecting problem
4,Very good earphone but price is too high it should be at 700 to 800 price. My U&I earphone which is cost of Rs. 499 produce the same output.

5,Very nice productGood batterySound quality best
5,I'm writing this after 15 days use.I have compared all the blutooth with oneplus. Nothing is best than this. If you are a music lover just blindly go for this. Only one cons that is mic if far from mouth compared to basic edition.

5,I can feel sound super sound quality..
4,"There is no product in the box it os empty , i gave for refund and replace also but they rejected that it is very bad to buy in online ☹️😔"

4,"I am very disappointed with this product. I invested money on this waste product. Bass is very low, when you try to hear on full volume then it's sounds hurt your ear. Can't put in your ear continue, starts pain. Also dealer don't return the product according to his policy it can be replace only."
5,Not happy with the product..you can't pick the call directly from the earphone..

5,Good sound
5,Nice product
4,All is well.But it's not good design.The earphone automatically sticks out of the ear.
4,"Sound is too high if heard in full sound, It would leave you with an unnecessary headache but overally if u hear it with the recomended sound,like u can rise up to the volume until your phone says ""More can cause damage"".                        And the call quality is not out of the box. The voice over the call gets a bit like disconnected.                  Overally the product is good but it is not a 100%                 I would give it a 85 our of 100.                                 ..."
5,Guys you can blindly trust to oneplus for this product. Seriously it's a superb superb bluetooth sound system. I'm fully satisfied
3,"Active noise cancellation is not up to the mark.Sound quality is good.Battery backup is also good, runs for 2 days with a good usage.Also facing lot of connectivity issues with my redmi note 7 during calling, sometimes voice does not come"

5,The bass is too overpowering. no details in the sound and the soundstage is poor. I dont get who likes these. Luckily i didnt get these for myself
4,Do Not expect so much !! Yes but still better than any other brands in this price segment. Of course you cannot expect performance like DR. Beats or any other upper brands.
5,"This product is absolutely amazing for Calls, music, and especially during this online calls and classes, It works really well and connectivity never lags. Go for it.I'm not a gamer so I can't tell about it, But Music, bass, calls All 3 are just 5 stars."

3,It's one of the best bluetooth neckband at this price range . It supports fast charging and have a C- port &hence you did not have to carry a seperate wire for changing.Its sound quality is great also it cancel noise at a good level. You won't face any problem while talking over a call in low to moderate outside noise level.A highly recommended product

5,I would admire the sound qualities are really that boosting. But I want to tell something about the bassI found somewhere that this bass boosting feature is somehow affecting the mid or high mid sounds. Overall boosting sound.But I will suggest Realme Neckband as that product costs lower than this and the sound quality is not that different.

4,"Ok so i have got this in best deal around 1650 in big billion days.Product is good than I expected. Bettery backup is good. Lasting for upto 18-19 hours of continuous listening the music. Sound delay is the problem in the game and video (little bit fluctuation delay in vocal and video)Bass is pretty good but not that kind of awesom, but honestly, comparing to another brand like boat, OnePlus is the winner.I have written this review after using for 7 days."

I have used Boat, JBL headphone but this OnePlus is beyond the other brands. One thing I liked it gets disconnected when two magnet connect each other, which really helpful for saving battery. I have used it for playing Games like BGMI, PUBG, COD...there is a little lag but cannot be identified. battery back really appreciated.Go for it it's ..."

5,"Absolutely happy since the day I've got these. Amazing sound with comfort. I don't think you can get anything better than this in 2k range. I listen to a lot of different genres (EDM, Hip Hop, Pop, Rock and Metal) and have no issues. It just sounds perfect no matter which song you throw at it. Talking about bass, it is there and provides a powerful thump but in no way is overpowering. It's not like other earphones in this range where it's only bass. In a nutshell, awesome sound and very happy..."

5,"If you are looking for quick switch feature of one plus bulletz then go with the regular variant instead of this bass edition. One plus description says that it works differently but for all practical purposes it is not there. It says that we need to switch by going on the bluetooth setting which totally defeats the purpose of quick switch. Don't be mislead, because if you order this product in error thinking that it has quick switch feature then you won't be able to return it as flipkart..."

3,"1. The mic is quite noisy when taking a call. You hear a constant flickering sound when you are on a call and the person on the other end can hear the same which doesn't allow you to take a call through these pair of earphones.2. It turns off when it's on charge, which means that you cannot use it while it's charging.In all other departments like build, battery and sound however, it works just perfectly!"
4,"Sir or Ma'am, the Sony can't compete with this one.. I have the sony headphone also, but this one sound's good..I have used so much wireless headphones, so many different brands also, but no one can compete with this one.. The Deep Bass really feels in our ears...just loved it.. For the bass the 5 Star is not enough... 😍😍"
